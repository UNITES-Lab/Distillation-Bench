The right half of the picture would include the two donuts on the right side (top right and bottom right). The food to the left of these right-side donuts would be the donuts on the left side (top left and bottom left). Since the question asks for the food to the left of the picture on the right, it likely refers to the donut on the left side of the right donut in the same row.
