INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
The current observation shows a Magento Admin Dashboard page. The page contains various sections including a menu bar, a main content area, and several tables displaying data about products, customers, and search terms. The main content area includes tabs for Bestsellers, Most Viewed Products, New Customers, and Customers. The Bestsellers tab is currently selected and shows a table with product information including price and quantity. However, this table does not contain products with 3 units left.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard. It contains a menu bar with various sections including DASHBOARD, SALES, CATALOG, CUSTOMERS, MARKETING, CONTENT, REPORTS, STORES, and SYSTEM. The main content area shows a variety of information such as revenue charts, bestsellers, recent orders, and search terms. The Bestsellers tab is currently selected and displays a table with products, their prices, and quantities. However, this table does not include products with 3 units left.

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
96, 90, 85, 57, 67, 61, 63, 65

REASON:
To find products with 3 units left, we need to navigate to a more comprehensive product inventory or search function. The "CATALOG" link in the menu bar is likely to lead us to a section where we can access detailed product information, including inventory levels.

ACTION:
click [96]

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
The current observation shows the search results for "Carnegie Mellon University" on OpenStreetMap. The page includes:
1. A search box [12] containing "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh"
2. A "Go" button [516] next to the search box
3. A heading "Search Results" with a "Close" button [968]
4. A list of search results for Carnegie Mellon University, including links to different addresses
5. A map view [23] with zoom controls, location services, and layer options

The search results provide multiple addresses for Carnegie Mellon University, which is crucial for our task.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The page displays search results for Carnegie Mellon University. The most relevant information for our task is:
1. A search box [12] with the query "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh"
2. A heading "Search Results" with a "Close" button [968]
3. Multiple links to different addresses of Carnegie Mellon University:
   - [980]: "Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive Extension, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States"
   - [982]: "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States"
   - [984]: "Carnegie Mellon University, 407, South Craig Street, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States"
4. A map view [23] with various controls and options

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
980, 982, 984, 23, 12, 516

REASON:
To determine the most relevant address for our task, we should examine the search results and choose the main campus location. The first result [980] appears to be the most appropriate, as it specifies the Schenley Drive Extension in North Oakland, which is likely the main campus location.

ACTION:
click [980]

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
We are currently on the Product Reviews Report page in the Magento Admin Panel. The page displays a table with product review information, including ID, Product name, Reviews, Average rating, Last Review date, and a "Show Reviews" link. There are 127 records found, and the table is paginated with 7 pages in total. The page also includes options to export data to CSV or Excel XML, search, and reset filters.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page shows the Product Reviews Report with a table listing various products and their review information. Each product has a "Show Reviews" link that likely leads to more detailed review content. There's a search functionality and options to export data or reset filters. The page displays "127 records found", indicating a large dataset. The table shows review counts for each product, ranging from 3 to 4 reviews per product.

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
3861, 3869, 3877, 3885, 3893, 3901, 3909, 3917, 3925, 3933, 3941, 3949, 3957, 3965, 3973, 3981, 3989, 3997, 4005, 4013, 3603, 3604, 3599, 3614, 3615

REASON:
To find the total number of reviews mentioning "disappointed", we need to analyze the review content for each product. Clicking on the "Show Reviews" link for each product will allow us to see individual review texts, where we can search for the term "disappointed".

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
The current observation shows a GitLab dashboard page. The page displays a list of projects, but it doesn't directly show the user's todo list. There is a navigation menu at the top of the page that includes a "To-Do List" link with ID [423]. This link is particularly relevant to our task of checking out the user's todos.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is a GitLab dashboard showing various projects and options. The main content area lists projects, their visibility status, and some statistics like issue counts and last activity times. The navigation menu at the top of the page includes links to different sections of GitLab, such as Dashboard, Issues, Merge requests, and importantly, the "To-Do List" link we're looking for.

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
423, 424, 420, 421, 418, 1636

REASON:
The "To-Do List" link is the most direct path to the user's todo list, which is our objective.

INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
