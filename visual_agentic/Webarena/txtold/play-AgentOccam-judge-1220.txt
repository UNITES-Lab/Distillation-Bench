PREVIOUS PLANS:
[0] (Active Plan) Find the solution to "Create a discussion post about "long distance relationship" in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt, "your opinion""

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
We are on the "Create submission" page. The page contains various input fields for creating a post:
- A radio button for selecting submission type (currently set to "URL")
- A textbox for entering a URL (currently not required)
- A required textbox for entering the post title
- A textbox for entering the post body (not required, but we'll use it)
- A checkbox for "Formatting help"
- A combobox for selecting the forum (subreddit)
- A "Create submission" button to submit the post

The radio button for "URL" is currently checked, which we need to change to create a text-based discussion post.

REASON:
To create our discussion post about long-distance relationships, we need to:
1. Change the submission type to text-based (not URL-based)
2. Enter an appropriate title
3. Enter the body text with our question
4. Select an appropriate forum
5. Submit the post

For this step, we'll change the submission type to text-based, as we want to create a discussion post, not share a URL. The radio button for "URL" is currently checked (element ID 2008), so we need to click it to uncheck it and switch to text-based submission.

ACTION:
click [2008]
