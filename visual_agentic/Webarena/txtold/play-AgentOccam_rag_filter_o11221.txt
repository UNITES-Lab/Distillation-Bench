OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
We are on the "Create submission" page of Postmill. The form contains fields for URL, Title, and Body. The URL radio button [1968] is currently checked. The title field [1977] contains our previously entered text "Long distance relationships". There's a body field [1987] which is currently not required. A forum selection combobox [1907] is present, and there's a "Create submission" button [2109] at the bottom of the form.

REASON:
We need to switch from URL to text post mode to enter our discussion prompt in the body field. Since our previous attempt to uncheck the URL radio button didn't work, we'll try clicking it again. This action might toggle between URL and text post modes, allowing us to proceed with entering our prompt.

ACTION:
click [1968]
