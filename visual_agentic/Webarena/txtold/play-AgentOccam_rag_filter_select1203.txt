PREVIOUS PLANS:

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page displays a list of commits to the awesome-python repository. Each commit entry includes the author's name, commit message, date, and a unique commit hash. The commits are sorted chronologically, with the most recent ones at the top. The page shows commits from various contributors, including Vinta Chen, who appears to be a frequent contributor.

Key observations:
1. The page title indicates we are viewing commits for the "master" branch.
2. There's a search box to search commits by message.
3. Commits are grouped by date, showing the most recent ones first.
4. Each commit shows the author's avatar, name, commit message, and timestamp.
5. There's no immediate information about the total number of commits per contributor.

REASON:
To find the number of commits by the top contributor to the main branch, we need to navigate to a page that shows contributor statistics. The current commits page doesn't provide an overview of contributions per user. GitLab typically has a dedicated "Contributors" page that would be more suitable for our task.
