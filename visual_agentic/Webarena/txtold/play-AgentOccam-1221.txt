Check out the most recent open issues

PREVIOUS PLANS:
[0] (Active Plan) Find the solution to "Check out the most recent open issues"

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
We are now back on the main repository page for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" on GitLab. The page displays project information, navigation options, and file structure. Importantly, there's a link to "Issues" in the left sidebar navigation, showing a count of 40 issues. The main content area shows project details, including commit count, branches, tags, and a brief description of the project. There's also an alert about SSH key configuration.

REASON:
Since our previous attempt to view the issues resulted in an error, we should try accessing the Issues page again. The Issues link in the left sidebar still shows 40 issues, indicating that they exist but might have failed to load previously due to a temporary issue.

ACTION:
click [4134]
