INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`

Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0.

E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.

Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0.

If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`.

OBJECTIVE:

STEP:
3

URL:
http://127.0.0.1:9999/f/gaming/25/-/edit

INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`.
