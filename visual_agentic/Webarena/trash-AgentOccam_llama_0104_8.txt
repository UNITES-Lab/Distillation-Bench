INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY :
**You have started the interaction with the task objective to find the walkway to the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.**

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current webpage is the OpenStreetMap homepage. It has a search bar, a button to find directions between two points, and links to various features and settings. The page also contains information about the OpenStreetMap project and its contributors.

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
**35, 503, 516**

REASON:
To find the walkway to the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, we need to use the OpenStreetMap to find the location of the business and then find the nearest walkway to it. The search bar on the current page is the most relevant element for this task, so we will start by interacting with it.

ACTION:
type [35] [401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh] [1] 

This will search for the location of the business on the OpenStreetMap, and then we can proceed to find the nearest walkway to it. If the search is successful, we can then use the "Find directions between two points" button to find the walkway to the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business. If not, we will need to refine our search keywords or try related terms. 

### Note:
Please make sure to explore the results of the search and the directions to the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business. If the task cannot be completed, please indicate "N/A" and provide the reasons.  ### END ### .INTERACTION HISTORY : stop [N/A...] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY :
You are currently on the OpenStreetMap page with address 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh. You searched for the location and the results are displayed on the page. You are trying to find the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The webpage displays a map with the location 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh marked on it. There is a search box where you can enter locations to find directions between two points. Below the search box, there are several links to various features of the OpenStreetMap website, including links to edit the map, view the map's history, and export the map. The webpage also displays search results, with the first result being the Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15206, United States. Below the search results, there are links to various features of the OpenStreetMap website, including links to the website's contributors and a donation page.

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
608, 613, 516, 35, 22, 20, 19

REASON:
The task requires finding the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh. The OpenStreetMap page displays search results, with the first result being a local business, the Kenmawr Apartments. However, this result is not a grocessory. To find the closest chain grocessory, we need to click on the "Find directions between two points" link and enter the location of a nearby chain grocessory.

ACTION:
click [516] 

Note that I've highlighted the link to "Find directions between two points" in the OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT section, as this is the next step in the task. I've also included the id of the search box in the OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT section, as we may need to interact with it later to enter the location of a nearby chain grocessory. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to refine the plan. If I need to refine the plan, please let me know what the new subplan should be and I will issue the corresponding action command. If the current plan is correct, I will proceed with the next step. 

Please respond with the next step or refine the plan. If you think I should stop, please let me know and I will provide the final answer.

If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY :
* Entered the OpenStreetMap page at '401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh'.
* The user selected the car mode for routing.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The page displays a map centered at '401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh' with an interactive interface. There are various links and buttons for navigation, settings, and additional features. The 'From' and 'To' textboxes allow users to specify start and end points. A combobox allows selecting different routing modes (Bicycle, Car, Foot). Buttons for calculating directions and reversing the route are visible.

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
296, 311, 313, 708, 703, 678, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 309, 311, 313, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 309

REASON:
The current step is to input the starting and ending points for the route. The user has already selected the car mode for routing, which is the most appropriate mode for finding the walkway to the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business.

ACTION:
click [665] 

Explanation: The user should input the starting point, which is '401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh'. The textbox 'From' is currently empty and should be filled with the starting point. Then, the user should input the ending point, which is the closest chain grocessory owned by a local business. However, the ending point is unknown, so the user will have to input the address of a local business that sells chain groceries. After inputting the starting and ending points, the user can click the 'Go' button to calculate the route. Therefore, the first step is to click on the 'From' textbox to input the starting point.

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

INSTRUCTION:
You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
