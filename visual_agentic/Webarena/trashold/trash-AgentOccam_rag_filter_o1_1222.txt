INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, I'm looking at a GitLab dashboard page showing various projects. The objective is to create a new group called "x-lab" with specific members. Let's break this down:

1. We need to find a way to create a new group, not just a project
2. The group needs to be named "x-lab"
3. We need to add 5 specific members to this group

Looking at the page elements, I don't see any direct option to create a group. However, there's a "Create new..." link that might lead us to the right place. Let's explore that first.

The most relevant element for our task seems to be:
[418] 'Create new...'

This link is likely to give us options for creating new entities in GitLab, which should include groups. It's our best starting point.

I should also note down the members we need to add, just in case:
JonasVautherin, dilipchandima, dawiss1337, bmyun, DCMJY

Now, let's click on the "Create new..." link to see what options it gives us.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
This is the initial observation of the GitLab dashboard. No previous interactions have occurred yet.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page appears to be the GitLab Projects Dashboard. It displays a list of projects with various details such as visibility, activity, and statistics. The page includes navigation links at the top, a search bar, and options to filter and sort projects. Importantly, there's a "Create new..." link [418] which is likely our entry point for creating a new group.

REASON:
To create a new group, we need to find the appropriate menu or page. The "Create new..." link is the most promising option on this page for initiating the creation of a new entity, which should include the option to create a group.

ACTION:
click [418]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
418, 305, 420, 421, 423, 424, 426

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze the given instruction and observations to understand the trajectory and summarize the key steps and overall purpose.\n\nFirst, the instruction is to create a new group called "x-lab" with specific members. However, the observations don\'t show any actions related to creating a group or adding members. This is interesting - there seems to be a mismatch between the instruction and what\'s actually shown in the observations.\n\nLooking at the observations, what I see is:\n1. A GitLab projects dashboard page\n2. A list of various projects, some public and some private\n3. Project details like star counts, fork counts, last updated times\n4. Navigation elements like search, filters, and links to other GitLab sections\n\nThe observations seem to be a static view of an existing projects page, rather than showing any actions being taken. There\'s no evidence of group creation or member management happening.\n\nSo in terms of significant steps or actions taken, I can\'t really identify any based on these observations. The page appears to be in a static state, just displaying existing information.\n\nAs for the higher-level purpose, it seems the goal here is simply to view and browse existing projects on GitLab. The page provides ways to filter and search projects, see key metrics at a glance, and navigate to individual project pages. It\'s essentially a dashboard for project management and overview.\n\nThis creates an interesting tension with the original instruction. Perhaps the intention was to show how one would navigate to a place where group creation could happen, but the actual process isn\'t captured in these observations.\n\nGiven this analysis, I\'ll need to be careful in my response to acknowledge both the original instruction and what the observations actually show, while noting the discrepancy between them.\n```\n\nBased on the observations provided, I cannot identify any significant steps or actions taken related to creating a new group or adding members. The observations show a static view of a GitLab projects dashboard, displaying existing projects and their details.\n\nThe higher-level purpose evident from these observations appears to be project management and overview. The dashboard allows users to view, filter, and search through various projects, see key metrics like star and fork counts, and easily navigate to individual project pages.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that there\'s a discrepancy between the initial instruction (to create a new group "x-lab" with specific members) and the actual content of the observations, which don\'t show any actions related to group creation or member management. The observations don\'t capture the process of creating a new group or adding members to it.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: create a new group "x-lab" with members JonasVautherin, dilipchandima, dawiss1337, bmyun, DCMJY\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'Projects Dashboard GitLab\'\n\tlink [199] \'Skip to content\'\n\tlink [321] \'Dashboard\'\n\tbutton [411]\n\ttextbox [1636] \'Search GitLab\' [required: False]\n\tgeneric [1597] \'Use the shortcut key kbd//kbd to start a search\'\n\tlink [418] \'Create new...\'\n\tlink [420] \'Issues\'\n\t\tgeneric [1229] \'17 assigned issues\'\n\tlink [421] \'Merge requests\'\n\t\tgeneric [1231] \'10 merge requests\'\n\tlink [423] \'To-Do List\'\n\t\tgeneric [1247] \'Todos count\'\n\t\t\ttext \'10\'\n\tlink [424] \'Help\'\n\tlink [426] \'Byte Blaze\'\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'Projects\'\n\t\tlink [305] \'New project\'\n\t\tlink [428] \'Yours 14\'\n\t\tlink [429] \'Starred 3\'\n\t\tlink [430] \'Explore\'\n\t\tlink [431] \'Topics\'\n\t\tsearchbox [312] \'Filter by name\'\n\t\tbutton [377] \'Name\'\n\t\tlink [475] \'All\'\n\t\tlink [476] \'Personal\'\n\t\tlink [477] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [484] \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\n\t\tgeneric [482] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\tgeneric [1337] \'lipstick\'\n\t\ttext \'Accessible light and dark syntax highlighting themes\'\n\t\tlink [507] \'1\'\n\t\tlink [508] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [509] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [510] \'1\'\n\t\ttime \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\n\t\t\ttext \'1 year ago\'\n\t\tlink [523] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [530] \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\n\t\tgeneric [528] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\tgeneric [1356] \'globe with meridians\'\n\t\ttext \'A webring for digital accessibility practitioners.\'\n\t\tlink [553] \'2\'\n\t\tlink [554] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [555] \'1\'\n\t\tlink [556] \'4\'\n\t\ttime \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\n\t\t\ttext \'1 year ago\'\n\t\tlink [569] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [576] \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\n\t\tgeneric [574] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\ttext \'Maintainer\'\n\t\ttext \'The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.\'\n\t\tlink [599] \'21\'\n\t\tlink [600] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [601] \'11\'\n\t\tlink [602] \'41\'\n\t\ttime \'Dec 24, 2024 12:23pm EST\'\n\t\t\ttext \'1 day ago\'\n\t\tlink [615] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [622] \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\n\t\tgeneric [620] \'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

The system message will tell it what it can do, instruction is our final goal, interaction history is some finished steps, observation is what we see now, and based on these thing we want gpt model to predict next action to achieve our goal. \n                Here is some action choice and meaning:\n                click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task.

However, there\'s no direct option visible for creating a new group.\n\nExternal Knowledge:\n1. The first external knowledge describes navigating to an "Explore" page on GitLab to view all public projects. This isn\'t directly relevant to creating a new group.\n2. The second external knowledge is similar to the first, focusing on exploring projects rather than group creation.\n\nEvaluation:\nUnfortunately, neither of the provided external knowledge pieces are particularly helpful for the task of creating a new group. They focus on exploring projects, which is not related to group creation. The information doesn\'t provide guidance on how to navigate to group creation functionality or how to add members to a group.\n\nTo be helpful, we would need external knowledge that includes information such as:\n1. Where to find the option to create a new group in GitLab\'s interface\n2. The process of creating a group and adding members\n3. Any specific GitLab features or menus related to group management\n\nSince the provided external knowledge doesn\'t offer this kind of information, I cannot identify any as useful for predicting the next action to create a new group "x-lab" with the specified members.\n\nUseful External Knowledge: []\n```\n\nThe provided external knowledge is not useful for predicting the next action to create a new group "x-lab" with specified members.
