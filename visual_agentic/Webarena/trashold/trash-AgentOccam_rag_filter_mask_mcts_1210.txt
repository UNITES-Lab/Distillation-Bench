INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Okay, let's break this down and think through the task at hand:

1. Rephrasing the objective:
We need to invite Abishek to a repository as a guest so he can check the dotfile configurations.

2. Initial impressions:
This appears to be a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. We need to find the correct repository and then figure out how to invite a user.

3. Broader context:
GitLab is a platform for version control and collaboration, so inviting a user to a repository is a common task. However, we don't immediately see an option for this on the current page.

4. Known and unknown elements:
Known: We're on a projects dashboard.
Unknown: Which repository contains the dotfile configurations, and where the option to invite users is located.

5. Why the human might ask this:
They likely want Abishek to review or provide feedback on their dotfile configurations, but don't want to give full access to the repository.

6. Relevant knowledge:
In GitLab, inviting users is usually done within a specific project's settings.

7. Potential ambiguities:
We don't know which repository contains the dotfile configurations.

Now, let's explore the problem space:

1. Core components:
   a) Find the correct repository
   b) Access the repository's settings
   c) Invite Abishek as a guest

2. Requirements:
   - Locate the repository with dotfile configurations
   - Navigate to the correct page to invite users
   - Add Abishek with guest permissions

3. Constraints:
   - We can only interact with elements visible on the current page

4. Successful response:
   Inviting Abishek to the correct repository as a guest

5. Knowledge needed:
   - GitLab navigation
   - Project settings
   - User permission levels in GitLab

Let's generate multiple hypotheses:

1. The dotfile configurations might be in a personal repository
2. It could be in a repository named something related to "dotfiles" or "configurations"
3. It might be a private repository

Now, let's start our discovery process:

Looking at the page, I don't immediately see a repository that clearly relates to dotfiles. However, I notice there's a search box [384] for filtering projects by name. This could be useful for finding the right repository if it's not immediately visible.

I'm also noticing that some repositories are public and some are private. The dotfile configurations might be in a private repository for security reasons.

Given this information, I think our best course of action is to use the search functionality to try and locate the correct repository. We can start by searching for "dotfiles" or "config" to see if any matching repositories appear.

Let's test this approach:

```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
This is the first interaction, so there's no previous history to summarize.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is a GitLab Projects Dashboard. It displays a list of projects with various details such as visibility (public/private), star count, and last update time. There's a search box [384] labeled "Filter by name" which can be used to find specific projects. The projects are a mix of public and private repositories, covering various topics.

REASON:
To invite Abishek to the repository with dotfile configurations, we first need to locate the correct repository. Using the search functionality is the most efficient way to find a specific project among many. We'll start by searching for "dotfiles" as it's a common term for configuration files.

ACTION:
type [384] [dotfiles] [1]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
384, 526, 527, 528, 529, 457, 573, 574, 575

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nLet me analyze the given information and summarize the key aspects:\n\nHmm, this seems to be a view of a GitLab projects dashboard. The user is looking at a list of various projects, some public and some private. There\'s a mix of personal projects and those belonging to organizations like "Byte Blaze".\n\nThe dashboard shows quite a bit of information for each project:\n- Project name and owner\n- Public/private status\n- Brief description\n- Stats like stars, forks, issues, etc.\n- Last activity timestamp\n\nFrom what I can see, there\'s no direct action taken in this view - it\'s more of an overview or landing page. The user hasn\'t clicked into any specific project or taken any particular action.\n\nNow, about the actual instruction given... The human wants to invite Abishek to check their dotfile configurations. This is interesting because it\'s not directly related to what we\'re seeing in the GitLab dashboard. Dotfiles are typically personal configuration files, often stored in a Git repository for version control and easy sharing/syncing.\n\nSo, the goal here seems to be:\n1. Locate the repository containing the dotfiles (which isn\'t visible in the current view)\n2. Invite Abishek as a guest to that specific repository\n\nThis implies a few things:\n- The user likely has a separate repository for their dotfiles\n- They want to give Abishek read access to review these configurations\n- They\'re using GitLab\'s collaboration features to facilitate this review\n\nTo accomplish this, the user would need to:\n1. Navigate to the correct repository (probably not visible in this current projects list)\n2. Access the repository settings\n3. Find the option to invite a new member\n4. Add Abishek with appropriate (guest) permissions\n\nIt\'s worth noting that the current view doesn\'t show us how to do any of these steps - we\'d need to navigate away from this projects dashboard to accomplish the goal.\n```\n\nBased on the instruction and the GitLab projects dashboard view provided, here\'s a summary of the situation and the steps needed:\n\n1. Current view: The user is looking at a GitLab projects dashboard, showing various public and private projects.\n\n2. Goal: Invite Abishek to check the user\'s dotfile configurations.\n\n3. Required actions (not visible in the current view):\n   - Navigate to the specific repository containing the dotfiles\n   - Access the repository settings\n   - Use GitLab\'s member invitation feature\n   - Add Abishek as a guest to the repository\n\nThe higher-level purpose of this task is to facilitate a code review or configuration check. By inviting Abishek as a guest to the dotfiles repository, the user is seeking input or verification on their personal configuration settings. This collaboration could be for troubleshooting, optimization, or simply sharing setups between developers.\n\nTo proceed, the user would need to navigate away from the current projects dashboard and locate the specific repository containing their dotfiles. From there, they can use GitLab\'s built-in collaboration tools to invite Abishek with the appropriate permissions.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Abishek wants to check my dotfile configurations.

The user identifies a specific merge request titled \\"Add color utility classes\\" and clicks on it. This action navigates the user to a detailed view of the merge request.\\n\\nIn the new view, the user observes various details about the merge request, including its status, description, and previous comments. The user then locates a text box for adding a new comment. The user types \\"Good idea\\" into this comment box.\\n\\nAfter typing the comment, the observation shows that the text \\"Good idea\\" now appears in the comment box, and the \\"Comment\\" button, which was previously disabled, is now enabled. This indicates that the user has successfully entered the desired comment and is now ready to submit it.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to navigate to a specific merge request in a GitLab project and add a supportive comment. The user is tasked with finding a merge request related to adding color utility classes, accessing its detailed view, and leaving a brief positive comment on the proposed changes.\\n\\nThis task involves navigating through a list of merge requests, identifying the correct one based on its title, clicking to view its details, locating the comment input area, and typing a short affirmative message. The trajectory demonstrates the user\'s ability to interact with GitLab\'s interface, understand the context of the merge request, and provide feedback in the form of a comment.\\n\\nThe purpose aligns with common code review practices in collaborative software development environments, where team members review and comment on each other\'s proposed changes before they are merged into the main codebase.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction to post \\"Good idea\\" for the merge request related to color utility in the a11yproject.com project. The user successfully navigates to the correct merge request and types the comment.\\n\\n2. Coherence: Each action logically follows from the previous observation. The user first identifies the correct merge request, then navigates to it, and finally types the comment.\\n\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior when interacting with a GitLab interface to review and comment on a merge request.\\n\\n4.

The user is presented with a list of projects, including their visibility status, ownership, and statistics such as stars, forks, and issues. The initial action is to identify repositories where the user made contributions but received no stars. \\n\\nThe first action taken is to stop at three specific repositories: \\"Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt\\", \\"Byte Blaze / dotfiles\\", and \\"Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space\\". This action is justified by the need to focus on repositories where the user is listed as the owner and which have zero stars.\\n\\nFollowing this action, another observation is made, revealing the same GitLab dashboard with no apparent changes. The user then repeats the same action, stopping at the same three repositories. This repetition suggests a confirmation of the initial findings or a potential issue with the interface response.\\n\\nThroughout the trajectory, the user maintains focus on identifying repositories that meet the specific criteria of user contribution and zero stars, demonstrating a consistent approach to fulfilling the stated objective.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to identify and list personal GitHub repositories that have not gained any popularity. Specifically, the task is to review a user\'s GitLab dashboard, which displays various repositories, and identify those projects where the user has made contributions but which have received no stars from other users.\\n\\nTo accomplish this, the user needs to:\\n\\n1. Access their GitLab dashboard and view the list of repositories.\\n2. Scan through each repository, paying attention to:\\n   a. The ownership status (looking for repositories where they are listed as \\"Owner\\" or have a role implying significant contribution)\\n   b. The number of stars (focusing on those with zero stars)\\n3. Make note of the full names of repositories that meet both criteria (user contribution and zero stars)\\n4. Compile a list of these repositories\\n\\nThis task requires careful examination of repository details, understanding of GitHub/GitLab metrics, and the ability to filter information based on specific criteria. The purpose is likely to help the user identify which of their projects might need more promotion or improvement to attract attention from the developer community.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\nThe instruction and trajectory are aligned, as the trajectory focuses on identifying repositories with no stars where the user has made contributions. The actions taken are coherent and logical, repeating the same step to potentially confirm findings. The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of scanning through a project dashboard. The approach is reasonable, directly addressing the task without unnecessary complications.

The observation provides details of various repositories, including their visibility (public/private), ownership, and statistics such as the number of stars. We can identify repositories with 0 stars by looking at the provided links and static texts for each repository. The repositories with 0 stars and where the user is listed as \\\\\\"Owner\\\\\\" or has a role that implies contribution (e.g., \\\\\\"Maintainer\\\\\\", \\\\\\"Developer\\\\\\") are the ones we are interested in.

The user clicks on the \\"Byte Blaze / dotfiles\\" repository link, which is identified as the likely location for the dotfile configurations. This action takes them to the repository\'s main page, where they can see details about the project, including its description, language breakdown, and recent commits.\\n\\nFrom the repository\'s main page, the user then clicks on the \\"Settings\\" link in the left sidebar. This action navigates them to the repository\'s settings page, where they can manage various aspects of the project, including member access. The settings page displays options for general settings, integrations, webhooks, access tokens, and other repository-specific configurations.\\n\\nThe trajectory stops at the settings page, which is where the user would typically find options to manage project members and potentially invite new collaborators like Jakub Klinkovsk\\u00fd.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to navigate to the settings page of a specific GitLab repository in order to add a new collaborator. The user starts from the GitLab dashboard, identifying and accessing the \\"dotfiles\\" repository, which contains computer setup configurations. Once inside the repository, the user seeks to find the appropriate location to manage project members and permissions.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates the initial steps required to invite a new collaborator to a GitLab project. It shows the user navigating through the GitLab interface, first locating the correct repository among multiple projects, then accessing that repository\'s main page, and finally navigating to the settings section where member management typically takes place.\\n\\nWhile the trajectory doesn\'t show the final step of actually inviting the collaborator, it positions the user at the correct location within the GitLab interface to perform this action. The purpose is to set up the environment for adding Jakub Klinkovsk\\u00fd as a guest to the repository, allowing him to check the dotfile configurations as requested in the original objective.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by navigating to the correct repository and reaching the settings page, which is a necessary step for inviting a new collaborator.\\n2. Coherence: Each action logically follows from the previous observation, moving from the project list to the specific repository and then to its settings.\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior in navigating a GitLab interface to manage project settings.\\n4.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RAG EXAMPLES:
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR REFERENCE: this is some example (or empty) you can refer to to complete the task (please do not mix the ids and descriptions in the examples with our current webpage observation. ):[[{"External Knowledge0": "\nSummarized Instructions:\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\nThe trajectory begins with the user on the GitLab \"New Project\" page. The user clicks on the \"Create blank project\" option, which leads to a form for creating a new repository. The user then types \"Do it myself\" into the project name field. After this action, the page updates to show the newly created \"Do it myself\" repository, including a successfully created README.md file. The user then clicks on the README.md file to view its contents. The final observation shows the README.md file open in the GitLab interface, displaying the default content for a new project. The trajectory ends with the user unable to proceed further as the next step would require accessing external resources (the DIY subreddit) to gather information for updating the README file, which is beyond the current environment's capabilities.\n\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nCreate a new public repository named \"Do it myself\" on GitLab, including an automatically generated README.md file. The task involves navigating through the GitLab interface to initiate a new project, providing the project name, and accessing the newly created README file. The purpose is to set up a basic project structure that can later be populated with content related to DIY ideas. However, the task is limited to the initial setup within the GitLab environment and does not include gathering or adding external content to the README file due to the constraints of the current system, which prevents direct access to external websites like Reddit for researching DIY ideas.\n\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nBased on the criteria provided, the evaluation of the trajectory and instruction is as follows:\n\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by successfully creating a new repository named \"Do it myself\" with a README file. However, it doesn't complete the full objective of adding DIY links.\n\n2. Coherence: Each action logically follows from the previous observation, with no contradictions between actions.\n\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics real-world interactions a user would perform when creating a new GitLab repository.\n\n4.

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
In the previous interaction, I searched for "dotfiles" in the GitLab Projects Dashboard to find the repository containing the dotfile configurations.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current observation shows the GitLab Projects Dashboard after searching for "dotfiles". The search results display a project named "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" [3034], which is a public repository. This project seems to be the one we're looking for, as it's described as "Computer setup" and matches the search term "dotfiles".

REASON:
Now that we've found the correct repository, the next step is to access it so we can invite Abishek as a guest. Clicking on the repository name will take us to its main page, where we should find options for managing collaborators or inviting users.

ACTION:
click [3034]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
3034, 2892, 2961, 2968

RAG LOG:
{'id': ['instructions_566_obs2_obs5'], 'llm prediction': 'Here is my analysis of the given information:\n\n```thinking\nOkay, let\'s break this down and think through what\'s happening here:\n\n1. Instruction and context:\nThe user wants to invite Abishek to check their dotfile configurations in a repo as a guest. This suggests we\'re dealing with some kind of version control or project management system.\n\n2. Observations:\nLooking at the observed interface elements, it\'s clear we\'re dealing with GitLab, a popular DevOps platform. The interface shows a Projects Dashboard with various navigation elements and a project list.\n\nKey points I\'m noticing:\n- There\'s a search box that has "dotfiles" entered\n- We can see a project called "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" in the results\n- It\'s marked as a public project\n- It has some basic stats (0 issues, 0 merge requests, 0 CI/CD, 4 stars)\n- It was updated 3 days ago\n\n3. Connecting the dots:\nThe user is likely looking at their own "dotfiles" repository on GitLab. They want to give Abishek access to this repo to check the configurations.\n\n4. What\'s missing:\nI don\'t see any direct actions taken in the trajectory - no clicks or navigation events are recorded. The interface snapshot doesn\'t show options for inviting users or changing permissions.\n\n5. Implied actions:\nBased on the instruction and the interface shown, we can infer that the user would need to:\na) Navigate to the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project\nb) Find the project settings or member management section\nc) Use a feature to invite a new member or collaborator\nd) Set Abishek\'s permissions to "Guest" level\n\nHowever, these actions aren\'t explicitly shown in the provided information.\n\nSo, to summarize and abstract the purpose:\nThe trajectory shows the user viewing their GitLab Projects Dashboard, with a focus on locating their "dotfiles" repository. The ultimate goal is to grant guest access to Abishek for this repository, allowing him to review the dotfile configurations. This involves using GitLab\'s project management and access control features to add a new collaborator with limited permissions.\n```\n\nBased on my analysis, here\'s a summary of the significant steps and actions, along with a higher-level abstraction of the purpose:\n\nSignificant steps/actions:\n1. The user accessed the GitLab Projects Dashboard.\n2. They searched for "dotfiles" in the project list.\n3. The "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project was located in the search results.\n\nHigher-level abstraction of purpose:\nThe overall goal of this trajectory is to prepare for granting guest access to a specific user (Abishek) for a dotfiles repository on GitLab. This involves locating the correct repository in order to subsequently modify its access settings. The purpose is to facilitate a code review or configuration check by allowing controlled, limited access to the project\'s contents.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that the actual steps of inviting Abishek and setting his permissions are not shown in the provided interface snapshot, but would be the logical next steps to fulfill the stated instruction.', 'external knowledge': '[{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins with the user on the GitLab \\"New Project\\" page. The user clicks on the \\"Create blank project\\" option, which leads to a form for creating a new repository. The user then types \\"Do it myself\\" into the project name field. After this action, the page updates to show the newly created \\"Do it myself\\" repository, including a successfully created README.md file. The user then clicks on the README.md file to view its contents. The final observation shows the README.md file open in the GitLab interface, displaying the default content for a new project. The trajectory ends with the user unable to proceed further as the next step would require accessing external resources (the DIY subreddit) to gather information for updating the README file, which is beyond the current environment\'s capabilities.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nCreate a new public repository named \\"Do it myself\\" on GitLab, including an automatically generated README.md file. The task involves navigating through the GitLab interface to initiate a new project, providing the project name, and accessing the newly created README file. The purpose is to set up a basic project structure that can later be populated with content related to DIY ideas. However, the task is limited to the initial setup within the GitLab environment and does not include gathering or adding external content to the README file due to the constraints of the current system, which prevents direct access to external websites like Reddit for researching DIY ideas.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, the evaluation of the trajectory and instruction is as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by successfully creating a new repository named \\"Do it myself\\" with a README file.

The user clicks on the \\"Create blank project\\" option, which leads to a form for creating a new repository. The user then types \\"Do it myself\\" into the project name field. After this action, the page updates to show the newly created \\"Do it myself\\" repository, including a successfully created README.md file. The user then clicks on the README.md file to view its contents. The final observation shows the README.md file open in the GitLab interface, displaying the default content for a new project. The trajectory ends with the user unable to proceed further as the next step would require accessing external resources (the DIY subreddit) to gather information for updating the README file, which is beyond the current environment\'s capabilities.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nCreate a new public repository named \\"Do it myself\\" on GitLab, including an automatically generated README.md file. The task involves navigating through the GitLab interface to initiate a new project, providing the project name, and accessing the newly created README file. The purpose is to set up a basic project structure that can later be populated with content related to DIY ideas. However, the task is limited to the initial setup within the GitLab environment and does not include gathering or adding external content to the README file due to the constraints of the current system, which prevents direct access to external websites like Reddit for researching DIY ideas.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, the evaluation of the trajectory and instruction is as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by successfully creating a new repository named \\"Do it myself\\" with a README file. However, it doesn\'t complete the full objective of adding DIY links.\\n\\n2. Coherence: Each action logically follows from the previous observation, with no contradictions between actions.\\n\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics real-world interactions a user would perform when creating a new GitLab repository.\\n\\n4.

This requires leaving the current GitLab environment and going to the Reddit environment to perform the search. However, as an autonomous agent, I can only perform actions within the current environment and cannot directly navigate to external sites like Reddit without a specific URL action. Therefore, the next logical step in this context cannot be performed based on the given instructions and limitations.\\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}"}, {"External Knowledge2": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins on the GitLab dashboard, showing a list of projects. The user clicks on the \\"Byte Blaze / dotfiles\\" repository link, which is identified as the likely location for the dotfile configurations. This action takes them to the repository\'s main page, where they can see details about the project, including its description, language breakdown, and recent commits.\\n\\nFrom the repository\'s main page, the user then clicks on the \\"Settings\\" link in the left sidebar. This action navigates them to the repository\'s settings page, where they can manage various aspects of the project, including member access. The settings page displays options for general settings, integrations, webhooks, access tokens, and other repository-specific configurations.\\n\\nThe trajectory stops at the settings page, which is where the user would typically find options to manage project members and potentially invite new collaborators like Jakub Klinkovsk\\u00fd.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to navigate to the settings page of a specific GitLab repository in order to add a new collaborator. The user starts from the GitLab dashboard, identifying and accessing the \\"dotfiles\\" repository, which contains computer setup configurations. Once inside the repository, the user seeks to find the appropriate location to manage project members and permissions.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates the initial steps required to invite a new collaborator to a GitLab project. It shows the user navigating through the GitLab interface, first locating the correct repository among multiple projects, then accessing that repository\'s main page, and finally navigating to the settings section where member management typically takes place.\\n\\nWhile the trajectory doesn\'t show the final step of actually inviting the collaborator, it positions the user at the correct location within the GitLab interface to perform this action. The purpose is to set up the environment for adding Jakub Klinkovsk\\u00fd as a guest to the repository, allowing him to check the dotfile configurations as requested in the original objective.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by navigating to the correct repository and reaching the settings page, which is a necessary step for inviting a new collaborator.\\n2. Coherence: Each action logically follows from the previous observation, moving from the project list to the specific repository and then to its settings.\\n3.

with an observation of a GitLab dashboard displaying various repositories. The user is presented with a list of projects, including their visibility status, ownership, and statistics such as stars, forks, and issues. The initial action is to identify repositories where the user made contributions but received no stars. \\n\\nThe first action taken is to stop at three specific repositories: \\"Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt\\", \\"Byte Blaze / dotfiles\\", and \\"Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space\\". This action is justified by the need to focus on repositories where the user is listed as the owner and which have zero stars.\\n\\nFollowing this action, another observation is made, revealing the same GitLab dashboard with no apparent changes. The user then repeats the same action, stopping at the same three repositories. This repetition suggests a confirmation of the initial findings or a potential issue with the interface response.\\n\\nThroughout the trajectory, the user maintains focus on identifying repositories that meet the specific criteria of user contribution and zero stars, demonstrating a consistent approach to fulfilling the stated objective.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to identify and list personal GitHub repositories that have not gained any popularity. Specifically, the task is to review a user\'s GitLab dashboard, which displays various repositories, and identify those projects where the user has made contributions but which have received no stars from other users.\\n\\nTo accomplish this, the user needs to:\\n\\n1. Access their GitLab dashboard and view the list of repositories.\\n2. Scan through each repository, paying attention to:\\n   a. The ownership status (looking for repositories where they are listed as \\"Owner\\" or have a role implying significant contribution)\\n   b. The number of stars (focusing on those with zero stars)\\n3. Make note of the full names of repositories that meet both criteria (user contribution and zero stars)\\n4. Compile a list of these repositories\\n\\nThis task requires careful examination of repository details, understanding of GitHub/GitLab metrics, and the ability to filter information based on specific criteria. The purpose is likely to help the user identify which of their projects might need more promotion or improvement to attract attention from the developer community.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\nThe instruction and trajectory are aligned, as the trajectory focuses on identifying repositories with no stars where the user has made contributions. The actions taken are coherent and logical, repeating the same step to potentially confirm findings. The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of scanning through a project dashboard. The approach is reasonable, directly addressing the task without unnecessary complications. However, the repetition of the same action might indicate a slight inefficiency or potential interface issue.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars?\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-github.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\\\\n\\\\n[1] RootWebArea \'Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[199] link \'Skip to content\'\\\\n\\\\t[320] link \'Dashboard\'\\\\n\\\\t[394] button \'\' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t[1507] textbox \'Search GitLab\' required: False\\\\n\\\\t[1468] generic \'Use the shortcut key <kbd>/</kbd> to start a search\'\\\\n\\\\t[401] link \'Create new...\'\\\\n\\\\t[403] link \'Issues\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1100] generic \'13 assigned issues\'\\\\n\\\\t[404] link \'Merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1102] generic \'8 merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t[406] link \'To-Do List\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1118] generic \'Todos count\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1489] StaticText \'5\'\\\\n\\\\t[407] link \'Help\'\\\\n\\\\t[409] link \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1152] img \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t[7] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[302] heading \'Projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[305] link \'New project\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[411] link \'Yours 14\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[412] link \'Starred 3\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[413] link \'Explore\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[414] link \'Topics\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[312] searchbox \'Filter by name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[374] button \'Name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[458] link \'All\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[459] link \'Personal\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[460] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[463] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[466] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[464] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[472] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1208] generic \'lipstick\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1499] StaticText \'\\ud83d\\udc84\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1209] StaticText \' Accessible light and dark syntax highlighting themes\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[484] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[485] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[486] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[487] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[496] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[21] time \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[497] StaticText \'1 year ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[498] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[501] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[504] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[502] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[510] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1227] generic \'globe with meridians\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1500] StaticText \'\\ud83c\\udf10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1228] StaticText \' A webring for digital accessibility practitioners.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[522] link \'2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[523] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[524] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[525] link \'4\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[534] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[33] time \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[535] StaticText \'1 year ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[536] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[539] heading \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[542] link \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[540] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[548] StaticText \'Maintainer\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1246] StaticText \'The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[560] link \'21\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[561] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[562] link \'10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[563] link \'40\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[572] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[45] time \'Mar 27, 2023 4:15pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[573] StaticText \'1 year ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[574] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[577] heading \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[580] link \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[578] generic \'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
Here's my response based on the current observation and task objective:

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
In the previous steps, we searched for the "dotfiles" repository on the GitLab Projects Dashboard and then accessed the repository page.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
We are currently on the main page of the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" repository. The repository contains various configuration files and setup instructions for a computer system. The page displays the repository's content, including a README.md file with setup instructions. The repository is public and contains 554 commits. There are navigation options on the left sidebar, including a "Settings" link [7621].

REASON:
To invite Abishek to the repository as a guest, we need to access the repository settings where we can manage collaborators or members. The "Settings" link in the left sidebar is likely where we'll find the option to invite new members or collaborators.

ACTION:
click [7621]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': 'Here is a brief summary and analysis of the key actions and overall purpose based on the provided information:\n\n```thinking\nHmm, let\'s break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial instruction is about inviting Abishek to check dotfile configurations in a repo. This suggests we\'re dealing with some kind of collaborative software development or configuration management task.\n\n2. The bulk of the information appears to be a detailed view of a GitLab repository page for a project called "dotfiles". This includes things like file listings, commit history, README contents, etc.\n\n3. The README itself contains extensive instructions for setting up a new system, including steps like:\n   - Cloning the repo\n   - Installing various software (Homebrew, npm packages, Ruby gems, etc.)\n   - Configuring system preferences, Finder, Dock, etc.\n   - Installing and setting up various applications\n\n4. There\'s a strong focus on customization and optimization of a macOS environment, with many specific tools and settings mentioned.\n\n5. The trajectory seems to end with references to further resources for Mac setup guides.\n\nSo, taking a step back, what\'s the higher-level purpose here? This appears to be a comprehensive guide for setting up a new Mac development environment, likely tailored to a specific individual\'s or team\'s preferences. The dotfiles repo serves as both a backup of these configurations and a way to easily replicate this setup on new machines.\n\nThe overall goal seems to be to standardize and automate as much of the system setup process as possible, ensuring consistency across different machines and making it easier to get up and running quickly on a new system. This kind of approach is common among developers who want to maintain a consistent, optimized working environment across multiple computers or when setting up new machines.\n```\n\nBased on this analysis, here\'s a brief summary:\n\nThe trajectory involves accessing a GitLab repository containing dotfiles and system setup instructions. The repository includes a detailed README with step-by-step guidance for setting up a new Mac development environment, covering everything from initial software installations to fine-tuning system preferences and application configurations. \n\nThe overall purpose appears to be to provide a standardized, easily replicable method for setting up a consistent development environment across multiple Mac systems, likely tailored to specific individual or team preferences. This approach aims to streamline the process of configuring new machines and maintaining a consistent working environment for software development tasks.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Abishek wants to check my dotfile configurations.

the user viewing a specific milestone page titled \\"Product Launch Milestone\\" within a GitLab project. The page displays details of the milestone, including its status (open), progress (0% complete), and tabs for issues, merge requests, participants, and labels. However, this existing milestone doesn\'t match the objective\'s specific date requirements.\\n\\nRealizing this, the user clicks on the \\"Milestones\\" link in the project navigation sidebar. This action navigates them to the Milestones overview page. The new page shows a list of existing milestones, including the \\"Product Launch Milestone\\" and another called \\"Product Launch\\". It also provides options to filter milestones, sort by due date, and most importantly, a \\"New milestone\\" link that would allow the creation of a milestone with the required specifications.\\n\\nThis trajectory demonstrates the user\'s attempt to locate the appropriate interface for creating a new milestone with specific start and end dates as per the original objective.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nNavigate to the Milestones page in a GitLab project to prepare for creating a new milestone.\\n\\nThe user starts on a specific milestone page within a GitLab project, likely realizing that this existing milestone doesn\'t meet the requirements for their task. Recognizing the need to create a new milestone with specific start and end dates, the user takes steps to navigate to the appropriate page where such action can be taken.\\n\\nBy clicking on the \\"Milestones\\" link in the project navigation sidebar, the user efficiently moves to the Milestones overview page. This page provides a comprehensive view of all existing milestones and, crucially, offers the option to create a new milestone. This navigation sets the stage for the next step of actually creating the milestone with the required specifications, including the start date of 1/16/2023 and end date of 1/30/2023 for the upcoming product launch event.\\n\\nThe trajectory showcases the user\'s ability to efficiently navigate the GitLab interface, moving from a specific milestone view to a broader milestones overview, positioning themselves to complete the task of creating a new, appropriately dated milestone for the product launch.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, the evaluation of the trajectory and instruction is as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction of navigating to the Milestones page to prepare for creating a new milestone. While it doesn\'t complete the full objective of creating the milestone, it successfully positions the user to do so.\\n\\n2. Coherence: The actions in the trajectory are logical and follow a clear path from viewing an existing milestone to navigating to the page where new milestones can be created.\\n\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of navigating through a web interface to find the correct location for performing a task.\\n\\n4. Reasonable: The approach taken is straightforward and efficient, avoiding unnecessary steps or complications.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, the trajectory and instruction pair meet all the criteria for a good match.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Create a milestone for the upcoming event of product launch

The title \\"add support for oh-my-zsh\\" is already set. The first action involves typing \\"Abishek\\" into the assignee search box, which results in Abishek appearing as a search result. The next action is to click on Abishek\'s name to assign him to the issue. Following this, the due date field is populated with \\"07/18/2033\\" as requested. The observation after this action shows that the date has been successfully entered and a calendar widget has appeared, allowing for date selection or confirmation. Throughout these steps, the interface remains consistent, showing various options for issue creation such as description, labels, and milestone, although these are not modified in this trajectory.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nCreate a new issue in the GitLab repository \\"dotfiles\\" with the title \\"add support for oh-my-zsh\\". Assign the issue to a user named Abishek and set the due date to July 18, 2033. The task involves navigating the GitLab interface for issue creation, searching for and selecting the correct assignee, and inputting the specified due date. This process demonstrates familiarity with GitLab\'s issue tracking system and the ability to set key parameters for issue management, including title, assignee, and due date. The task is focused on the initial setup of the issue without delving into additional details such as description or labels, emphasizing the core elements of issue creation in a collaborative development environment.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. The instruction and trajectory are aligned. The trajectory successfully accomplishes the goal of creating an issue with the specified title, assigning it to Abishek, and setting the due date as July 18, 2033.\\n2. The trajectory is coherent. Each action logically follows from the previous observation, and there are no contradictions in the actions taken.\\n3. The trajectory is natural, closely mimicking how a real user would interact with the GitLab interface to create an issue with specific parameters.\\n4. The trajectory is reasonable, using a straightforward and efficient method to accomplish the task without unnecessary complications or redundant actions.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Create an issue in dotfiles repo with title \\\\\\"add support for oh-my-zsh\\\\\\".

trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins on a GitLab dashboard page displaying various projects. The user is presented with a list of repositories, including one named \\"dotfiles\\" which is described as \\"Computer setup\\". This repository is identified as the target for inviting Jakub Klinkovsk\\u00fd to check the dotfile configurations.\\n\\nThe user then clicks on the link to the \\"dotfiles\\" repository (identified by [707]). This action navigates to the repository\'s main page. The new page displays detailed information about the \\"dotfiles\\" repository, including its public status, project ID, commit history, and file structure. The page also shows recent activity, such as the addition of a LICENSE file.\\n\\nThe trajectory ends at this point, with the user now on the main page of the \\"dotfiles\\" repository, where they would presumably take further actions to invite Jakub Klinkovsk\\u00fd as a guest.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nNavigate to the \\"dotfiles\\" repository on GitLab to prepare for inviting a guest collaborator. Starting from the GitLab dashboard, locate the \\"dotfiles\\" repository among the list of projects. This repository is described as \\"Computer setup\\" and is likely to contain the configuration files that need to be reviewed. Once identified, click on the repository link to access its main page. This action will take you to the detailed view of the \\"dotfiles\\" repository, where you can see its contents, commit history, and other relevant information. From this page, you will be able to proceed with the next steps to invite Jakub Klinkovsk\\u00fd as a guest to review the dotfile configurations. The purpose of this trajectory is to position yourself on the correct repository page, setting the stage for the subsequent invitation process.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by navigating to the correct repository for inviting a guest collaborator.\\n2. Coherence: The actions follow a logical sequence, moving from the project list to the specific repository.\\n3.

They discuss creating milestones and navigating GitLab project pages, which is unrelated to inviting a guest to a repository.\n\nExternal Knowledge2:\nThis is also not directly relevant, as it describes creating an issue in GitLab, which is not the current objective.\n\nExternal Knowledge3:\nThis knowledge is highly relevant and useful.
