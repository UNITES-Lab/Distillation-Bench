INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website. We give you the right website, please just explore. This task must 100% can be completed without requesting external information or human assistance. Required information should be obtained through your own actions. Keep exploring different approaches until you succeed - never give up or wait for human input.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, I'm looking at a product showcase page for "One Stop Market". This seems to be the main page of an online store, but I don't see the specific product we're looking for - the Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots.

Let's break this down:

1. We need to find "Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts"
2. We need to add 2 of these to the wish list

The current page doesn't show our target product. We'll need to search for it. I see a search bar at the top of the page, which is perfect for this.

The search functionality is represented by:
- combobox [1920] 'Search' [required: False]
- button [1923] 'Search' [disabled: True]

The search button is currently disabled, which likely means it will become enabled once we enter some text in the search box.

Our best action here would be to use the search function to look for the Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots. We should type the product name into the search box.

I'll propose this action, along with a backup plan in case the search doesn't yield results.

This thinking process naturally leads me to the following action candidates and observation highlights:
```

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: [Searching for the specific product is the most direct way to find it on this e-commerce site.]
- action: [type [1920] [Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots] [1]]

- reason: [If the search doesn't work or doesn't find the product, we might need to browse categories.]
- action: [click [1506] [Patio, Lawn & Garden]]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
1920, 1923, 1506, 1676, 1689

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze this interaction history and observations to understand what\'s happening here...\n\nThe user has given an instruction to add a specific product (Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots) to their wish list. However, the observations don\'t show any direct actions related to this instruction. Instead, they show a product showcase page of an online marketplace called "One Stop Market".\n\nLooking at the structure, I see:\n- A header area with account info, wish list, cart, and search functionality\n- A main content area showing various products with options to add to cart, wish list, or compare\n- A footer with newsletter signup and links\n\nThe products shown are mostly food and drink items, not the orchid roots mentioned in the instruction. There\'s no clear path to search for or add the requested item.\n\nThis seems to be a mismatch between the given instruction and the actual webpage state. The user wants to add something specific, but we\'re seeing a general product listing instead.\n\nIn terms of trajectory, there don\'t appear to be any significant steps or actions taken yet. The page is in a static state showing product listings.\n\nThe higher-level purpose here seems to be browsing or shopping on an e-commerce site, but it\'s not aligned with the specific goal stated in the instruction.\n\nGiven this analysis, I\'ll need to explain that the current page state doesn\'t match the instruction, and suggest some potential next steps for the user to accomplish their goal.\n```\n\nBased on the observations, there don\'t appear to be any significant steps or actions taken in the trajectory yet.

The user\'s objective is to add a white computer desk to their wish list. As there are no computer desks visible on the initial page, the user takes action by typing \\"white computer desk\\" into the search bar.\\n\\nAfter the search action, the page updates to show search results for \\"white computer desk\\". The new page displays a grid view of relevant products, including options like the EMMA + OLIVER White Computer Desk and the Tangkula White Computer Desk. Each product listing includes an image, name, price, and buttons for \\"Add to Cart\\", \\"Add to Wish List\\", and \\"Add to Compare\\". The page also shows filtering options by category and price range, as well as sorting options.\\n\\nThe trajectory ends at this point, with the search results displayed but no further action taken to add a specific desk to the wish list.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to search for a white computer desk on the One Stop Market website. The user starts on the homepage and uses the search functionality to find relevant products. The goal is to locate suitable white computer desk options that can potentially be added to the user\'s wish list.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates how to navigate from a general product page to specific search results for a desired item. It showcases the website\'s search capabilities and how the results are presented, including product images, names, prices, and action buttons for each item. The trajectory also reveals the website\'s organization of search results, including options for view type (grid or list), sorting, and filtering by category.\\n\\nWhile the ultimate objective of adding a desk to the wish list is not completed in this trajectory, it sets the stage for the next steps, which would likely involve reviewing the search results, selecting a specific desk, and using the \\"Add to Wish List\\" button for the chosen item.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, I evaluate the trajectory and instruction as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction to search for a white computer desk, although it doesn\'t complete the full task of adding it to the wish list.\\n2. Coherence: The actions taken are logical and build upon each other, starting from the homepage and progressing to search results.\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of searching for a product on an e-commerce website.\\n4. Reasonable: The approach taken is straightforward and efficient for finding white computer desk options.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\":

Instruction, Interaction History and Observations. The system message will tell it what it can do, instruction is our final goal, interaction history is some finished steps, observation is what we see now, and based on these thing we want gpt model to predict next action to achieve our goal. \n                Here is some action choice and meaning:\n                click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task. Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations. Should focus on helpful not just releted. If any External knowledges are useful, identify which ones have value and explain why they are useful. Finally, output the useful External knowledges in the format [External knowledge0, External knowledge1].'}], 'filter output': "```thinking\nLet me carefully analyze the given information and evaluate the usefulness of the provided External knowledge for predicting the next action:\n\nInstruction: Add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts to my wish list\n\nCurrent Observation: We're on the One Stop Market homepage, which shows various product categories and featured items. There's a search bar and options to view the wish list, which currently has 4 items.\n\nExternal Knowledge:\n1. Knowledge0 and Knowledge1 describe a trajectory of filling out a contact form for a refund request. This is not directly relevant to our current task of adding a specific product to the wish list.\n\n2. Knowledge2 describes a trajectory of searching for a white computer desk and viewing search results. While this shows how to use the search functionality, it's not specifically about adding items to a wish list.\n\nEvaluation:\nNone of the provided External knowledge pieces are particularly useful for predicting the next action in this specific task. Here's why:\n\n1. The task is about adding a specific product (Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots) to the wish list.\n2. The current observation shows we're on the homepage, not on a contact form or search results page.\n3. The external knowledge examples don't provide information about navigating to specific products or using the wish list functionality.\n\nTo predict the next action, the model would likely need to use the search functionality to find the specific product mentioned in the instruction. This general approach can be inferred from the current observation (presence of a search bar) without needing the external knowledge provided.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that none of the given External knowledge pieces are particularly useful for predicting the next action in this case.\n\nUseful External Knowledge: []\n```"}

- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's analyze this webpage carefully to understand what we're dealing with and how it relates to our objective of finding the product with the lowest per unit price across open tabs.

First, we're looking at a product page for "Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens Dental Shaping Silicone Tooth Tool". This seems to be one of the open tabs we need to consider. The price is clearly stated as $8.99, which is good information, but we need to be careful - this is for a set of 5 pieces, so the per unit price would actually be $8.99 / 5 = $1.798 per brush pen.

We don't have information about other open tabs or their products right now, so we can't make a final decision yet. However, we should definitely note down this information for comparison later.

The page has all the typical elements of an e-commerce product page - product images, description, price, add to cart button, etc. The "Add to Cart" button (element 1647) is particularly important as we'll need to use it if this turns out to be the product with the lowest per unit price.

One thing that's missing is a clear indication of how many tabs are open or what other products we need to compare. This means we'll likely need to navigate to other tabs to gather more information before we can make a decision.

Let's think about our next steps:

1. We need to note down the information about this product.
2. We should look for a way to switch to other open tabs to compare prices.
3. After comparing all products, we'll need to come back to the product with the lowest per unit price and add it to the cart.

For now, the best action seems to be to take a note of this product's information. Then we can look for a way to switch tabs or navigate to other products.

Now, let's prepare our response based on this thinking.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
This is the first interaction. We are on a product page for "Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens Dental Shaping Silicone Tooth Tool" priced at $8.99 for a set of 5 pieces.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The webpage displays a product page for "Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens Dental Shaping Silicone Tooth Tool". The price is clearly stated as $8.99 for a set of 5 pieces. The page includes typical e-commerce elements such as product images, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button (element 1647). There's no clear indication of other open tabs or how to switch between them.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: We need to record the information about this product for later comparison.
- action: note [Product: Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens, Price: $8.99, Quantity: 5, Per unit price: $1.798]

- reason: We might find navigation options to other tabs in the header or menu.
- action: click [1096]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
1647, 1096, 1675, 1678, 1315, 1311, 1307, 1303, 1299, 1295, 1291, 1287, 1283, 1279, 1275, 1271

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nOkay, let me carefully analyze this interaction and observation data to understand what\'s happening and summarize the key steps and overall purpose:\n\nFirst, I need to rephrase the human\'s instruction:\nThe user wants me to add the product with the lowest per unit price from their open tabs to the shopping cart.\n\nNow, looking at the observation data:\nHmm, this seems to be a product page for "Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens Dental Shaping Silicone Tooth Tool". The price shown is $8.99 for a pack of 5 brush pens.\n\nThere\'s no clear indication of multiple open tabs or other product options to compare prices. We only have information about this single product page.\n\nThe key elements I can see are:\n1. Product name and description\n2. Price ($8.99)\n3. Quantity selector (currently set to 1)\n4. "Add to Cart" button\n\nGiven the instruction and the available information, the logical steps would be:\n\n1. Verify this is indeed the product with the lowest per unit price (though we can\'t actually do this with the given information)\n2. Set the quantity to 1 (which it already is)\n3. Click the "Add to Cart" button\n\nHowever, it\'s important to note that we don\'t have enough context to know if this is truly the lowest priced item among multiple open tabs. We\'re only seeing one product page.\n\nThe higher-level goal here seems to be online shopping, specifically adding a cost-effective dental tool to the cart. The user appears to be price-conscious and looking to make an economical purchase.\n\nBut I should acknowledge that without seeing other product tabs or prices, we can\'t fully execute the original instruction of finding the lowest per unit price item. We can only work with the single product we see.\n```\n\nBased on the available information, here\'s a summary of the significant steps and the overall purpose:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1.

However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123].

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's analyze this webpage carefully. We're looking at a product page for Ciclon Energy Drink, but our task is to find the lowest per unit price across multiple open tabs and add that to the cart. This page alone won't give us enough information to complete the task.

First, I need to understand what we're seeing here:
- We're on a product page for Ciclon Energy Drink
- It's a 24-pack of 8.3oz cans
- The price shown is $36.99
- There's an "Add to Cart" button

But we don't have enough context to know if this is the lowest per unit price. We need to:
1. Calculate the per unit price for this product
2. Check other open tabs to compare prices
3. Determine which product has the lowest per unit price
4. Add that product to the cart

Let's start by calculating the per unit price for this product:
$36.99 / 24 cans = $1.54 per can

Now, we need to find a way to view other open tabs. The most logical next step would be to go back to a main page or search results page where we can see other products.

I'm looking for navigation elements that might help us do this... Ah, there's a "Home" link with ID 1440. That seems like a good place to start.

Let's click on that to hopefully see a list of other products or categories.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: Clicking the "Home" link will likely take us to a main page where we can view other products or categories, allowing us to compare prices and find the lowest per unit price.
- action: click [1440]

- reason: We could add this product to the cart now, but we don't know if it's the lowest per unit price yet. It's better to explore other options first.
- action: click [1670]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
1440, 1670, 1516, 1696, 1699, 1329, 1325, 1321, 1317, 1313, 1309, 1305, 1301, 1297, 1293, 1289, 1285

The "Home" link (1440) is our primary focus as it should lead us to more products. The "Add to Cart" button (1670) is important but premature at this stage. The search box (1696) and button (1699) could be useful later if we need to find specific products. The category links (1329, 1325, etc.) might be helpful for navigation. The "My Cart" link (1516) will be crucial when we're ready to add the lowest-priced item.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
This is the first interaction. We are on a product page for Ciclon Energy Drink, which costs $36.99 for a 24-pack of 8.3oz cans. The per unit price is calculated to be $1.54 per can.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page displays details for Ciclon Energy Drink - Regular 24 cans (8.3oz). The price is $36.99. There's an "Add to Cart" button (ID: 1670) and quantity selector. The page includes product details, reviews, and various navigation options. A "Home" link (ID: 1440) is present, which could lead to a main page or product listing.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: Clicking the "Home" link will likely take us to a main page where we can view other products or categories, allowing us to compare prices and find the lowest per unit price.
- action: click [1440]

- reason: We could add this product to the cart now, but we don't know if it's the lowest per unit price yet. It's better to explore other options first.
- action: click [1670]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
1440, 1670, 1516, 1696, 1699, 1329, 1325, 1321, 1317, 1313, 1309, 1305, 1301, 1297, 1293, 1289, 1285

RAG LOG:

Possible approaches:\na) Inform the user we can\'t compare prices due to lack of information\nb) Suggest adding this product to the cart as it\'s the only one we can see\nc) Ask for more information about other open tabs\n\n11. Evaluating options:\nOption (a) is honest but not very helpful. Option (b) might not align with the user\'s intent. Option (c) could be useful but might delay task completion.\n\n12. Decision:\nI think a combination of (a) and (b) would be most helpful. We\'ll explain the limitation and suggest an action the user can take if they want to proceed.\n\nNow, let\'s prepare a response based on this analysis...\n```\n\nBased on the available information, I can\'t determine if the Ciclon Energy Drink has the lowest per unit price, as we don\'t have details about any other products to compare it with. However, I can provide you with information about this product and suggest a possible action.\n\nThe Ciclon Energy Drink (Regular, 24 cans of 8.3oz each) is priced at $36.99. This works out to approximately $1.54 per can.\n\nIf you\'d like to proceed with this product, you can add it to your cart using the following steps:\n1. Locate the quantity selector (currently set to 1)\n2. Adjust the quantity if needed\n3. Click the "Add to Cart" button\n\nIf this isn\'t the product with the lowest per unit price from your open tabs, you may need to manually compare the prices of the other products you have open. If you\'d like assistance with that, please provide information about the other products, including their prices and quantities.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'Ciclon Energy Drink - Regular 24 cans (8.3oz)\'\n\tlink [1507] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [1503] \'My Wish List 4 items\'\n\tlink [1509] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [1405] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [1414] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [1516] \'My Cart\'\n\tcombobox [1696] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [2417] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [1699] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [1094]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[1329] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [1325] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [1321] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [1317] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [1313] \'Office Products\'; [1309] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [1305] \'Health & Household\'; [1301] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [1297] \'Electronics\'; [1293] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [1289] \'Video Games\'; [1285] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tlink [1440] \'Home\'\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'Ciclon Energy Drink - Regular 24 cans (8.3oz)\'\n\t\tgeneric [1281] \'Availability\'\n\t\t\ttext \'IN STOCK\'\n\t\ttext \'SKU\'\n\t\ttext \'B0776XKVMM\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 82\\tof 100\'\n\t\t\tlink [1525] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\t\tlink [1526] \'Add Your Review\'\n\t\ttext \'36.99\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\tspinbutton [1669] \'Qty\' [required: False] [valuemin: 0] [valuemax: 0] [valuetext: ]\n\t\t\t\ttext \'1\'\n\t\t\tbutton [1670] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1469] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1470] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [1476] \'Skip to the end of the images gallery\'\n\t\tlink [1480] \'Skip to the beginning of the images gallery\'\n\t\ttablist [1257]\n\t\t\ttab [1481] \'Details\' [selected: False]\n\t\t\t\tlink [1541] \'Details\'\n\t\t\ttabpanel \'Details\'\n\t\t\t\theading \'Product Quick Look\'\n\t\t\t\tListMarker [1266]\n\t\t\t\ttext \'Ciclón Energy Drink or CEnergy Drink, as known in the US market, is a functional carbonated drink with a formulation based on caffeine, B vitamin complex and taurine.

They navigate to a \\"Cell Phones & Accessories\\" category page, where they examine various products. The user identifies the \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\" as the lowest-priced item at $9.73 and adds it to the cart. They attempt to switch tabs to compare prices but are unable to do so directly through the interface. The user adds the same product to the cart a second time, possibly due to confusion or an attempt to ensure it was added successfully. Throughout the trajectory, the user expresses a desire to compare prices across tabs but is limited by the inability to directly access or switch between tabs in the given interface.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nNavigate to the \\"Cell Phones & Accessories\\" category on an e-commerce website. Browse the available products and identify the item with the lowest price. Add this item to your shopping cart. Attempt to compare prices with products in other open browser tabs, if possible. If unable to switch between tabs directly, focus on the products visible in the current tab. Ensure the lowest-priced item from the visible options is added to the cart, even if it means adding it multiple times to confirm the action. Throughout the process, maintain awareness of the limitation in accessing other tabs and focus on making the best decision based on the information available in the current view.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n\\n1. Alignment: Yes, the trajectory attempts to accomplish the goal of adding the lowest-priced item to the cart, although it\'s limited by the inability to compare across tabs.\\n\\n2. Coherence: Yes, each action logically follows from the previous observation, and there are no contradictory actions.\\n\\n3. Natural: Yes, the trajectory mimics real-world interactions a user might perform when shopping online and encountering limitations in tab navigation.\\n\\n4. Reasonable: Mostly yes, but adding the same item twice might be considered slightly unreasonable. However, this could be interpreted as a confirmation step given the limitations of the interface.\\n\\nBased on these criteria, the overall evaluation is:\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-shopping.awsdev.asapp.com/35-ft-hdmi-cable-gearit-pro-series-hdmi-cable-35-feet-high-speed-ethernet-4k-resolution-3d-video-and-arc-audio-return-channel-hdmi-cable-white.html\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): 35 Ft HDMI Cable, GearIT Pro Series HDMI Cable 35 Feet High Speed Ethernet 4K Resolution 3D Video and ARC Audio Return Channel HDMI Cable, White | Tab 1: DP to HDMI Cable 6FT (2 Pack), Fosmon Gold Plated Displayport to HDMI Cable 1080p Full HD for PCs to HDTV, Monitor, Projector with HDMI Port\\\\n\\\\n[1] RootWebArea \'35 Ft HDMI Cable, GearIT Pro Series HDMI Cable 35 Feet High Speed Ethernet 4K Resolution 3D Video and ARC Audio Return Channel HDMI Cable, White\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[1313] link \'My Account\'\\\\n\\\\t[1311] link \'My Wish List\'\\\\n\\\\t[1315] link \'Sign Out\'\\\\n\\\\t[1318] StaticText \'Welcome to One Stop Market\'\\\\n\\\\t[1220] link \'Skip to Content\'\\\\n\\\\t[1229] link \'store logo\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1321] img \'one_stop_market_logo\'\\\\n\\\\t[1322] link \'\\\\\\\\ue611 My Cart\'\\\\n\\\\t[2245] StaticText \'Search\'\\\\n\\\\t[1507] combobox \'\\\\\\\\ue615 Search\' autocomplete: both hasPopup: listbox required: False expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t[2248] link \'Advanced Search\'\\\\n\\\\t[1510] button \'Search\' disabled: True\\\\n\\\\t[1096] tablist \'\' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1098] tabpanel \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[40] menu \'\' orientation: vertical\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[791] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Beauty & Personal Care\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[856] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Sports & Outdoors\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[866] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[880] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Home & Kitchen\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[917] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Office Products\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[925] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Tools & Home Improvement\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[930] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Health & Household\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[936] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Patio, Lawn & Garden\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[941] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Electronics\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1002] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Cell Phones & Accessories\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1017] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Video Games\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1030] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Grocery & Gourmet Food\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t[1252] link \'Home\'\\\\n\\\\t[1255] StaticText \'35 Ft HDMI Cable, GearIT Pro Series HDMI Cable 35 Feet High Speed Ethernet 4K Resolution 3D Video and ARC Audio Return Channel HDMI Cable, White\'\\\\n\\\\t[5] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1256] heading \'35 Ft HDMI Cable, GearIT Pro Series HDMI Cable 35 Feet High Speed Ethernet 4K Resolution 3D Video and ARC Audio Return Channel HDMI Cable, White\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[11] generic \'Availability\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[13] StaticText \'IN STOCK\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1330] StaticText \'SKU\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1463] StaticText \'B00HRJA1D8\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1263] LayoutTable \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1465] StaticText \'Rating:\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1333] generic \'87%\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[2220] StaticText \'% of\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[2223] StaticText \'100\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1334] link \'12\\\\\\\\xa0 Reviews \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1335] link \'Add Your Review\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1337] StaticText \'$25.04\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1278] LayoutTable \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1479] StaticText \'Qty\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1480] spinbutton \'Qty\' required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1481] button \'Add to Cart\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1280] link \'Add to Wish List\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1281] link \'Add to Compare\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1286] link \'Skip to the end of the images gallery\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1121] button \'Previous\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1123] generic \'Image\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[2251] img \'Image\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1122] button \'Next\'\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\"action\\": \\"click [1098]\\",\\n            \\"reason\\": \\"To add the product with the lowest per unit price to the shopping cart, I need to compare the prices of the products in the open tabs.

E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123].

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are a seasoned web navigator. You now assess the value and risk of serveral web navigation actions based on the objective, the previous interaction history and the web's current state. Then, you select the action with the most value and least risk with which you would earn the maximum objective fulfillment reward in the future.

Adhere to the following output format:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
Review critically why the plans have not been fulfilled or the objective achieved. Justify your assessment with detailed evidence drawn from the objective, observations, and actions taken. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [1506] [Patio, Lawn & Garden]
|	reason for action [0]:
If the search doesn't work or doesn't find the product, we might need to browse categories.

|	action [1]:
type [1920] [Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots] [1]
|	reason for action [1]:
Searching for the specific product is the most direct way to find it on this e-commerce site.


RESPONSE:
Here's my assessment and action selection based on the given information:

```thinking
Let me analyze the current situation and the available actions:

Hmm, we're on what seems to be the homepage of an e-commerce site called "One Stop Market". Our objective is to add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 by Discount Hawaiian Gifts to the wish list. 

The current observation doesn't show any direct evidence of the product we're looking for. This makes sense, as we haven't searched for it yet. We're essentially at the starting point of our task.

Looking at our action choices, we have two options:

1. Click on the "Patio, Lawn & Garden" category
2. Search for "Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots"

The first action of browsing categories might be useful if we couldn't find the product through search, but it's not the most direct approach. The "Patio, Lawn & Garden" category could potentially include our product, but it's not guaranteed.

The second action, searching directly for the product, is more likely to yield immediate results. It's the most straightforward way to find a specific item on an e-commerce site.

Let's assess each action:

Action 0 (clicking on "Patio, Lawn & Garden"):
Value: Moderate. It could lead us to the right category, but it's not guaranteed.
Risk: Low to moderate. We might waste time if the product isn't in this category.
Best case: We find a subcategory that includes orchid roots.
Worst case: We don't find the product and have to backtrack.

Action 1 (searching for "Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots"):
Value: High. This is the most direct way to find the specific product we're looking for.
Risk: Low. Even if the search doesn't yield exact results, it should give us related products or categories.
Best case: We immediately find the exact product we're looking for.
Worst case: The search doesn't find the exact product, but gives us related items or categories to explore.

Given this analysis, searching for the product directly seems like the best course of action. It has the highest potential value with the lowest risk. Let's go with Action 1.
```

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[] [No concrete proof from observation] [The plan has not been executed yet. We are still at the initial stage of finding the product.]

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Moderate value as it might lead to the right category, but not guaranteed] [Low to moderate risk of wasting time if the product isn't in this category] [Best case: Find a subcategory that includes orchid roots] [Worst case: Don't find the product and have to backtrack]
- action [1]: [High value as it's the most direct way to find the specific product] [Low risk as even if the search doesn't yield exact results, it should give related products or categories] [Best case: Immediately find the exact product] [Worst case: Search doesn't find the exact product but gives related items or categories to explore]

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let me think through this carefully...

First, I need to rephrase what we're trying to do here. The objective is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the shopping cart. We're currently looking at a product page for dental resin brush pens.

The current plan seems quite broad - just "Find the solution". We haven't made much progress on that yet, as we're still gathering information. 

Let's break down what we know and what we need to do:

1. We're on a product page for Tazrigo dental resin brush pens
2. The price is $8.99 for a pack of 5, so the per unit price is $1.798
3. We don't know what other products are in the other open tabs or their prices
4. We need to gather information on all products before we can compare and choose the lowest per unit price
5. After finding the lowest, we need to add it to the cart

Looking at our action choices:

Action 0 suggests clicking on the tablist [1096]. This might lead us to other product categories, but it's not clear if it will take us to our other open tabs. It's a bit risky as it might lead us away from the current product without recording its information.

Action 1 proposes noting down the information about this product. This seems like a safe and valuable action. We need this information to compare with other products later.

Given these considerations, I think the best course of action is to note down the information about this product before we potentially navigate away from it. This ensures we have the data we need for later comparison.

Now, let's assess our plan progress and actions more formally:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[] [We are on a product page for Tazrigo dental resin brush pens] [We have not yet gathered information on all products or compared their prices]

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Medium value - could potentially lead to other product tabs, but uncertain] [Medium risk - might navigate away from current product without recording its information] [Best case: Finds navigation to other open tabs] [Worst case: Leads to unrelated pages, losing current product information]
- action [1]: [High value - records essential information about the current product for later comparison] [Low risk - doesn't change the current page state] [Best case: Accurately records product information for later use] [Worst case: No negative outcome, just records information]

Based on this assessment, I believe action 1 is the most appropriate choice at this stage. It has high value and low risk, and it's a necessary step towards our objective. Let's select that action.

ACTION SELECTION:
1

  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, I'm looking at a product showcase page for "One Stop Market". The objective is to add a specific lingerie item to the wish list, but I don't see that product listed here. Let's think this through...

The product we're looking for is "DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit". This is clearly not on the current page, which seems to be showing mostly food and beverage items.

We need to find a way to search for or navigate to this specific product. The most direct approach would be to use the search function. I see a search combobox with ID 2429, so that's our best bet.

One thing to note - the search button (ID 2432) is currently disabled. This likely means it will become enabled once we enter some text in the search field. That's a common web design pattern.

Let's use the search function to look for our target product. We'll use some key terms from the product name to increase our chances of finding it.

I think "DkRgVNY Lace Bodysuit" would be a good search term. It includes the brand name (or product code) and a key descriptor. If that doesn't work, we can try other combinations later.

Alright, let's go ahead and perform the search:
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
This is our first interaction. We are on the main product showcase page of One Stop Market, but the specific lingerie item we're looking for is not visible.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is a product showcase for "One Stop Market". It displays various items, mostly food and beverages. There's a search functionality at the top of the page with a combobox (ID 2429) for entering search terms and a currently disabled search button (ID 2432). The page also has navigation elements like "My Account", "My Wish List", and category links.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: We need to find the specific lingerie item, and the most efficient way to do this is by using the search function.
- action: type [2429] [DkRgVNY Lace Bodysuit] [1]

- reason: If typing doesn't automatically trigger a search, we might need to click the search button.
- action: click [2432]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
2429, 2432, 1861, 1711

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nOkay, let me carefully analyze this interaction and trajectory to summarize the key steps and overall purpose:\n\nHmm, looking at the observations, this seems to be an e-commerce website called "One Stop Market". The user is logged in as Emma Lopez and there\'s a wish list with 14 items and a cart with 10 items. \n\nThe main content shows a product showcase with various food and beverage items like gingerbread house kits, energy drinks, teas, and seasonings. Each product has options to add to cart, wish list, or compare.\n\nNow, the instruction given is to add a specific lingerie item to the wish list. However, I don\'t see that exact product listed in the observations. This is interesting...\n\nThe trajectory doesn\'t show any clear actions being taken yet. It\'s more of a snapshot of the current page state rather than a sequence of steps.\n\nSo what\'s the overall purpose here? It seems the goal is to add an item to the wish list, but the item isn\'t visible on the current page. This suggests the user may need to search for the item first before being able to add it to their wish list.\n\nLet me summarize this:\n\nBrief summary of steps:\n1. User is on the One Stop Market homepage, logged in as Emma Lopez\n2. Product showcase is displayed with various food/beverage items\n3. No clear actions have been taken yet\n\nHigher-level purpose:\nThe overall goal appears to be adding a specific lingerie item to the user\'s wish list. However, since that item isn\'t visible on the current page, the implied next steps would likely involve searching for the item before it can be added to the wish list.\n\nThis trajectory seems to represent the starting point of the task rather than its execution. The user will likely need to use the search function or navigate to the appropriate category to find the desired lingerie item before they can add it to their wish list.\n```\n\nBased on my analysis, here\'s a summary of the trajectory:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. User is logged into the One Stop Market website as Emma Lopez\n2. The homepage is displayed, showing a product showcase of various food and beverage items\n\nPurpose of the trajectory:\nThe overall goal is to add a specific lingerie item (DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit) to the user\'s wish list.

In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are a seasoned web navigator. You now assess the value and risk of serveral web navigation actions based on the objective, the previous interaction history and the web's current state. Then, you select the action with the most value and least risk with which you would earn the maximum objective fulfillment reward in the future.

Adhere to the following output format:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
Review critically why the plans have not been fulfilled or the objective achieved. Justify your assessment with detailed evidence drawn from the objective, observations, and actions taken. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [1670]
|	reason for action [0]:
We could add this product to the cart now, but we don't know if it's the lowest per unit price yet. It's better to explore other options first.

|	action [1]:
click [1440]
|	reason for action [1]:
Clicking the "Home" link will likely take us to a main page where we can view other products or categories, allowing us to compare prices and find the lowest per unit price.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's take a moment to analyze our current situation and the progress we've made towards our objective. We're tasked with adding the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the shopping cart. Right now, we're on a product page for Ciclon Energy Drink, but we haven't explored any other tabs or products yet.

Let's assess our plan progress:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[] [We're currently on a product page for Ciclon Energy Drink] [We haven't started comparing prices or exploring other tabs yet]
	[] [No concrete steps taken towards finding the lowest per unit price] [We need to explore other products to make a comparison]

Now, let's consider our action options:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Medium value. Adding this product to the cart would complete part of our objective, but we don't know if it's the lowest per unit price.] [High risk. If we add this to the cart without exploring other options, we might not fulfill the objective of finding the lowest per unit price.] [Best case: This happens to be the lowest priced item and we've completed the objective.] [Worst case: We add an item that's not the lowest priced, failing to meet the objective.]

- action [1]: [High value. Clicking "Home" will likely allow us to view other products or categories, which is necessary to compare prices.] [Low risk. Even if the home page doesn't immediately show other products, it's a logical step towards finding more options to compare.] [Best case: The home page shows a variety of products with clear per unit pricing, allowing us to quickly compare and find the lowest.] [Worst case: The home page doesn't show products directly, but it should still provide navigation to product categories.]

Analyzing these options, it's clear that we need more information before we can confidently add a product to the cart. We haven't explored any other tabs or products yet, so we can't be sure if the Ciclon Energy Drink is the lowest per unit price.

ACTION SELECTION:
1

I've chosen action 1, which is to click on the "Home" link. This is the most logical next step because:

1. It allows us to explore more products and potentially see other open tabs.
2. It's a low-risk action that doesn't commit us to any purchase yet.
3. It's necessary to fulfill our objective of finding the lowest per unit price across all open tabs.

By going to the home page, we'll likely have access to more product categories or a broader view of available items, which is crucial for making price comparisons. This action has the highest potential value for progressing towards our objective while maintaining the lowest risk of making a premature decision.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website. We give you the right website, please just explore. This task must 100% can be completed without requesting external information or human assistance.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's analyze the current situation and figure out how to add those specific slippers to the wish list.

First, I need to rephrase what we're trying to do: We want to add a pair of light blue, low-heeled summer slippers for women to the wish list. These slippers have chunky heels, pointed toes, and a wine glass design. They're described as comfortable walking shoes suitable for parties.

Looking at the current page, I don't see any immediate options for these specific shoes. We're on what appears to be a homepage or main product page for "One Stop Market". There's a variety of products shown, but none of them are the slippers we're looking for.

So, our first step should be to search for these slippers. I see a search bar at the top of the page with ID 2429. That's probably our best bet to find the specific product we want.

Now, how should we phrase our search? We want to be specific enough to find our product, but not so specific that we might miss it if the exact wording doesn't match. Let's focus on the key features:

"Light blue summer low heel slippers women"

This covers the main aspects without being too restrictive. If we don't find what we're looking for, we can always refine the search later.

Alright, let's go ahead and perform this search.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
No previous interactions have been recorded. We are starting fresh with the task of adding specific slippers to the wish list.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
We are on the main page of an online store called "One Stop Market". The page displays various product showcases, but none of them are the slippers we're looking for. There's a search bar at the top of the page with ID 2429, which we can use to find our desired product.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: To find the specific slippers we're looking for, we need to use the search function.
- action: type [2429] [Light blue summer low heel slippers women] [1]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
2429, 2432, 1861, 3237

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze this interaction and trajectory to understand what\'s happening here...\n\nThe user has given an instruction to add a specific product to their wish list. The product is described as "Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes".\n\nLooking at the observations, I see we\'re on an e-commerce website called "One Stop Market". The user (Emma Lopez) is logged in and already has 14 items in their wish list and 10 items in their cart. \n\nThe main content shows a product showcase with various items like food, drinks, and kitchen supplies. Each product has options to add to cart, wish list, or compare.\n\nInterestingly, I don\'t see the specific product mentioned in the instruction anywhere in the visible content. This suggests the user hasn\'t found or navigated to that product yet.\n\nSo in terms of significant steps taken, there don\'t appear to be any concrete actions performed yet related to the instruction. The trajectory seems to just be showing the initial state of the website.\n\nAs for the higher-level purpose, it seems the user\'s goal is to add a specific fashion item to their wish list, but they haven\'t yet taken the steps to find and add that item. The current page doesn\'t appear to be in the right category for that product.\n\nTo accomplish their goal, the user would likely need to:\n1. Use the search function or navigate to the appropriate category (probably something like "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry")\n2. Find the specific product they\'re looking for\n3. Click the "Add to Wish List" button for that item\n\nBut none of those steps have been taken yet based on what we can see here. The trajectory is essentially just showing the starting point before any action has been taken towards the stated goal.\n```\n\nBased on the analysis of the interaction and trajectory, here\'s a summary:\n\nSignificant steps or actions taken:\n- No significant steps have been taken yet towards the stated goal.\n- The trajectory shows the initial state of the "One Stop Market" e-commerce website.\n- The user is logged in and viewing a product showcase page.\n\nHigher-level purpose or goal:\nThe user\'s goal is to add a specific fashion item (Light Blue Summer Low Heels Slippers) to their wish list. However, the current page doesn\'t show this item, suggesting the user needs to search for or navigate to the appropriate product category before they can complete their intended action.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes to my wish list\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'One Stop Market\'\n\tlink [1865] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [1861] \'My Wish List 14 items\'\n\tlink [1867] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [1791] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [1800] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [1874] \'My Cart 10 10items\'\n\tcombobox [2429] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [3237] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [2432] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [1066]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[1719] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [1715] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [1711] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [1707] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [1703] \'Office Products\'; [1699] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [1695] \'Health & Household\'; [1691] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [1687] \'Electronics\'; [1683] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [1679] \'Video Games\'; [1675] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'One Stop Market\'\n\t\ttext \'Product Showcases\'\n\t\tlink [2351] \'Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit Value Pack, 17 oz., Pack of 2, Total 34 oz.\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 20\'\n\t\t\tlink [3115] \'1 Review\'\n\t\ttext \'19.99\'\n\t\tbutton [3121] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1530] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1890] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2355] \'V8 Energy, Healthy Energy Drink, Steady Energy from Black and Green Tea, Pomegranate Blueberry, 8 Ounce Can ,Pack of 24\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 57\'\n\t\t\tlink [3124] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'14.47\'\n\t\tbutton [3130] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1544] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1902] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2359] \'Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, Orange Vanilla Caffeine-free Fruit Infusion, 16-Ounce Pouch\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 95\'\n\t\t\tlink [3133] \'4 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'19.36\'\n\t\tbutton [3139] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1558] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1914] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2363] \'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix Wedding Colorful Sprinkles Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles Ice cream Candy Sprinkles Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles, 8OZ\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 63\'\n\t\t\tlink [3142] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'23.50\'\n\t\tbutton [3148] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1572] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1922] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2369] \'So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip Light, Vegan, Non-GMO Project Verified, 9 oz.

The initial observation shows various menu items and product listings. The first action is to hover over the \\"Sports\\" menu item to explore further options. This doesn\'t change the page content significantly. Next, the user clicks on the \\"Sports\\" menu item, which refreshes the page but doesn\'t seem to narrow down the category as expected. The user then hovers over the \\"Sports & Outdoors\\" menu item, which reveals a submenu with more specific categories like \\"Hunting & Fishing,\\" \\"Exercise & Fitness,\\" and \\"Sports.\\" Throughout these actions, the main product listings remain unchanged, displaying items such as women\'s boots, baseball bases, waterproof cameras, and cases. The trajectory shows a user attempting to navigate to a more specific category, particularly looking for competitive swimwear, but not quite reaching that goal within the observed steps.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be navigating an e-commerce website to find and list products from the competitive swimwear category by ascending price. The user starts on a general sports and outdoors page and attempts to narrow down the category by exploring the menu options. They first try the \\"Sports\\" category, then move to the broader \\"Sports & Outdoors\\" category, revealing more specific subcategories. The user\'s actions suggest they are searching for a way to access the competitive swimwear section, which is not immediately visible in the main categories. The trajectory demonstrates the initial steps of category exploration and navigation, although it doesn\'t reach the specific competitive swimwear category or implement the price sorting within the observed actions. The purpose involves both finding the correct product category and preparing to sort the items by price in ascending order, tasks that are initiated but not completed in the given trajectory.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the beginning of the instruction but does not complete the goal of listing competitive swimwear products by ascending price.\\n2. Coherence: Each action logically follows from the previous observation, showing a consistent attempt to navigate to the desired category.\\n3. Natural: The actions mimic natural user behavior when searching for a specific category on an e-commerce site.\\n4. Reasonable: The trajectory takes a reasonable approach to finding the category, though it doesn\'t reach the final goal within the given steps.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below

E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's analyze the current situation and think about how to approach this task...

First, I need to rephrase what we're trying to do here. We're looking to add a specific item - the HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens - to the wish list. This is a pretty straightforward task, but there are a few things to consider.

Looking at the current webpage, I don't immediately see the product we're looking for. This seems to be a general product showcase page for "One Stop Market". The items displayed are quite diverse, ranging from food items to household products, but I don't see any clothing items, let alone the specific Hawaiian outfit we're looking for.

So, our first step should be to find this product. The most efficient way to do this would likely be using the search function. I see a search combobox with ID 2429 at the top of the page. That's probably our best bet for locating the item quickly.

However, before we jump into searching, I should note a few things:

1. There's a "My Wish List" link (ID 1861) in the header. This could be useful later when we need to verify if the item has been added successfully.
2. The search button (ID 2432) is currently disabled. This might mean it only becomes enabled once we start typing in the search box.
3. There's an "Advanced Search" link (ID 3237) which could be useful if our initial search doesn't yield results.

Alright, let's proceed with searching for the item. We'll use the search combobox to enter our query. I'll use a concise but specific search term to increase our chances of finding the exact item.

One last thought - if the search doesn't work or doesn't find our item, we might need to explore the "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" category from the menu (ID 1711), as our item would likely be found there.

Let's go ahead with the search action.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
This is the initial step. We are on the main page of One Stop Market, which displays various products but not the specific Hawaiian outfit we're looking for.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the main page of One Stop Market. It contains a header with account-related links, a search function, and a menu of product categories. The main content showcases various products, mostly food and household items. There's no sign of the HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set we're looking for.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: Searching for the specific product is the most efficient way to find it on this e-commerce site.
- action: type [2429] [HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits] [1]

- reason: If the search doesn't work, we might need to navigate through the clothing category.
- action: click [1711]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
2429, 2432, 3237, 1861, 1711

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze this interaction and observation data to understand what\'s happening here:\n\nFirst, I need to clearly restate the human\'s instruction:\nThe user wants to add a specific product (HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens) to their wish list.\n\nNow, looking at the observations:\nThis appears to be a product listing page for an online marketplace called "One Stop Market". I see a header with account info, search functionality, and category navigation. The main content shows a grid of product listings with images, prices, ratings, and action buttons.\n\nInterestingly, I don\'t see the specific product the user wants to add anywhere in this listing. This presents a challenge.\n\nKey elements I\'m noticing:\n- The user (Emma Lopez) is logged in\n- There\'s a "My Wish List" link showing 14 items already in the list\n- Each product has an "Add to Wish List" button\n\nBut without the target product visible, the user can\'t directly add it to their wish list from this page.\n\nSo what actions could the user take here?\n1. Use the search bar to find the specific product\n2. Navigate through categories to locate the product\n3. Go to a different page that might list the product\n\nGiven this context, here\'s my analysis of the trajectory:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. User arrived at the One Stop Market product listing page\n2. User intended to add a specific product to their wish list\n3. The desired product is not visible on the current page\n\nHigher-level goal:\nThe overall purpose seems to be for the user to add a specific item to their wish list, but they\'ve encountered an obstacle because the item isn\'t on the current page. The implied next step would be to search for or navigate to the desired product before being able to add it to the wish list.\n\nThis trajectory shows an incomplete action - the user has a goal but hasn\'t been able to complete it yet due to the current page state. The next logical action would be to search for the product or navigate to a page where it\'s listed.\n```\n\nBased on my analysis, here\'s a summary of the trajectory:\n\nBriefly summarize the significant steps or actions taken throughout the trajectory:\n1. The user accessed the One Stop Market product listing page while logged in.\n2. The user intended to add a specific Hawaiian beach outfit set to their wish list.\n3. The desired product was not visible on the current page, preventing immediate addition to the wish list.\n\nProvide a higher-level abstraction of the purpose or goal of the trajectory actions:\nThe overall goal of this trajectory was for the user to add a specific item (HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set) to their wish list. However, this goal was not achieved in the observed interaction because the desired product was not present on the current page. The trajectory represents an incomplete action, where the user\'s intention is clear but the necessary steps to fulfill that intention (such as searching for the product or navigating to the correct page) have not yet been taken.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits to my wish list\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'One Stop Market\'\n\tlink [1865] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [1861] \'My Wish List 14 items\'\n\tlink [1867] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [1791] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [1800] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [1874] \'My Cart 10 10items\'\n\tcombobox [2429] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [3237] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [2432] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [1066]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[1719] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [1715] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [1711] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [1707] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [1703] \'Office Products\'; [1699] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [1695] \'Health & Household\'; [1691] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [1687] \'Electronics\'; [1683] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [1679] \'Video Games\'; [1675] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'One Stop Market\'\n\t\ttext \'Product Showcases\'\n\t\tlink [2351] \'Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit Value Pack, 17 oz., Pack of 2, Total 34 oz.\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 20\'\n\t\t\tlink [3115] \'1 Review\'\n\t\ttext \'19.99\'\n\t\tbutton [3121] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1530] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1890] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2355] \'V8 Energy, Healthy Energy Drink, Steady Energy from Black and Green Tea, Pomegranate Blueberry, 8 Ounce Can ,Pack of 24\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 57\'\n\t\t\tlink [3124] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'14.47\'\n\t\tbutton [3130] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1544] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1902] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2359] \'Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, Orange Vanilla Caffeine-free Fruit Infusion, 16-Ounce Pouch\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 95\'\n\t\t\tlink [3133] \'4 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'19.36\'\n\t\tbutton [3139] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1558] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1914] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2363] \'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix Wedding Colorful Sprinkles Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles Ice cream Candy Sprinkles Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles, 8OZ\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 63\'\n\t\t\tlink [3142] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'23.50\'\n\t\tbutton [3148] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1572] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1922] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [2369] \'So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip Light, Vegan, Non-GMO Project Verified, 9 oz.

The user\'s objective is to add a white computer desk to their wish list. As there are no computer desks visible on the initial page, the user takes action by typing \\"white computer desk\\" into the search bar.\\n\\nAfter the search action, the page updates to show search results for \\"white computer desk\\". The new page displays a grid view of relevant products, including options like the EMMA + OLIVER White Computer Desk and the Tangkula White Computer Desk. Each product listing includes an image, name, price, and buttons for \\"Add to Cart\\", \\"Add to Wish List\\", and \\"Add to Compare\\". The page also shows filtering options by category and price range, as well as sorting options.\\n\\nThe trajectory ends at this point, with the search results displayed but no further action taken to add a specific desk to the wish list.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to search for a white computer desk on the One Stop Market website. The user starts on the homepage and uses the search functionality to find relevant products. The goal is to locate suitable white computer desk options that can potentially be added to the user\'s wish list.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates how to navigate from a general product page to specific search results for a desired item. It showcases the website\'s search capabilities and how the results are presented, including product images, names, prices, and action buttons for each item. The trajectory also reveals the website\'s organization of search results, including options for view type (grid or list), sorting, and filtering by category.\\n\\nWhile the ultimate objective of adding a desk to the wish list is not completed in this trajectory, it sets the stage for the next steps, which would likely involve reviewing the search results, selecting a specific desk, and using the \\"Add to Wish List\\" button for the chosen item.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, I evaluate the trajectory and instruction as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction to search for a white computer desk, although it doesn\'t complete the full task of adding it to the wish list.\\n2. Coherence: The actions taken are logical and build upon each other, starting from the homepage and progressing to search results.\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of searching for a product on an e-commerce website.\\n4. Reasonable: The approach taken is straightforward and efficient for finding white computer desk options.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\":

In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123].

E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are a seasoned web navigator. You now assess the value and risk of serveral web navigation actions based on the objective, the previous interaction history and the web's current state. Then, you select the action with the most value and least risk with which you would earn the maximum objective fulfillment reward in the future.

Adhere to the following output format:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
Review critically why the plans have not been fulfilled or the objective achieved. Justify your assessment with detailed evidence drawn from the objective, observations, and actions taken. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

We need to find the specific lingerie item, and the most efficient way to do this is by using the search function.


RESPONSE:
Here is my analysis and action selection:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[] [No concrete proof from observation] [The plan to add the specific lingerie item to the wish list has not been successful because we haven't found the item yet. The current page shows various products, but none of them match the desired lingerie item.]

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Low value, as the search button is currently disabled] [Low risk] [Best case: The button becomes enabled after typing and allows us to initiate the search] [Worst case: The button remains disabled and clicking it has no effect]
- action [1]: [High value, as it initiates the search for the desired product] [Low risk] [Best case: The search results will show the desired lingerie item, allowing us to proceed with adding it to the wish list] [Worst case: The search might not yield the exact item, but it will still narrow down the results and bring us closer to our objective]

1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification

3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [1711]
|	reason for action [0]:
If the search doesn't work, we might need to navigate through the clothing category.

|	action [1]:
type [2429] [HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits] [1]
|	reason for action [1]:
Searching for the specific product is the most efficient way to find it on this e-commerce site.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let me carefully analyze the current situation and our progress towards the objective...

First, I need to rephrase the human's request to make sure I fully understand it:
The goal is to add a specific product - the HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Men, which is a summer tropical tree printed relaxed-fit Hawaii shirts and shorts 2 piece suit - to the wish list.

Now, looking at our current state and previous actions:
We're on what appears to be the homepage of an e-commerce site called "One Stop Market". We haven't taken any actions yet to search for or locate the specific product we're looking for. 

The current observation shows a variety of products on display, but none of them match our target item. This makes sense since we haven't searched for it yet.

Let's assess our plan progress:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[] [No concrete proof from observation] [We haven't taken any steps towards fulfilling this plan yet. The product we're looking for is not visible on the current page, and we haven't used the search functionality or navigated to a relevant category.]

Now, let's evaluate our action choices:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Moderate value. Clicking on the "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" category could potentially lead us to a page where we might find the Hawaiian outfit or a way to search within that category.] [Low risk. Worst case, we'd just need to navigate back to the homepage.] [Best case: We find a subcategory for men's beachwear or summer outfits.] [Worst case: We end up on a general clothing page and need to navigate back.]

- action [1]: [High value. Searching directly for the product name is likely the fastest way to find it.] [Low risk. If the search doesn't yield results, we can try other methods.] [Best case: The search returns the exact product we're looking for, allowing us to quickly add it to the wish list.] [Worst case: The search returns no results or unrelated items, in which case we'd need to try a different approach.]

Comparing these actions:
Action [1] seems to be the most direct and efficient approach. Searching for the product by name is typically the quickest way to find a specific item on an e-commerce site. It has a high potential value and low risk.

Action [0], while potentially useful, is less direct. We'd likely need to navigate through multiple pages to find the specific product, which could take more time and actions.

Given this analysis, I believe the most effective next step is to use the search function.

ACTION SELECTION:
1
```

I select action 1: type [2429] [HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits] [1]. This action has the highest potential to directly lead us to the product we're looking for, allowing us to efficiently work towards our objective of adding it to the wish list.

--------------------------------ACTOR--------------------------------
OBJECTIVE:
Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives

Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's analyze this webpage carefully to understand the product details and pricing information.

First, I need to confirm that this is indeed one of the open tabs mentioned in the objective. The product name "Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens" matches what I noted earlier, so this is definitely one of the tabs we're comparing.

Now, let's look at the key information:
- Product: Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens
- Price: $8.99
- Quantity: 5 pieces (from the product name and description)

I've already calculated the per unit price in my previous note: $1.798 per pen. This matches with the information on this page, so my calculation was correct.

At this point, I don't have enough information to determine if this is the product with the lowest per unit price. We need to check the other open tabs to compare. However, I've gathered all the necessary information from this page.

The next logical step would be to move to another open tab to gather information on another product. But... wait a second. I don't actually see any way to switch tabs or navigate to a different product page from the current observation. This is a limitation of the simulated browsing environment.

Given this constraint, I need to think about how to proceed. The most appropriate action would be to signal that I've completed gathering information from this tab and I'm ready to move on to the next one. However, there's no specific action provided for this scenario.

In this case, the best course of action might be to use the 'stop' command to indicate that I've finished examining this product and need to move on to the next tab. I'll include all the relevant information I've gathered in the response.

Let me prepare the action:
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
In the previous step, I noted the product details: Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens, Price: $8.99, Quantity: 5, Per unit price: $1.798.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current webpage displays details for the Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens. The price is confirmed as $8.99, and the product indeed comes in a set of 5 pieces. The page includes product features, dimensions, and other details, but no additional pricing information that would affect our per-unit price calculation.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: We have gathered all necessary information from this product page and need to move on to the next open tab to continue our comparison.
- action: stop [N/A. Completed analysis of Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens. Price: $8.99, Quantity: 5, Per unit price: $1.798. Ready to examine the next product.]

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nLet me think through this carefully...\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the instruction is asking for. The user wants to add the product with the lowest per unit price from their open tabs to the shopping cart. However, this observation only shows one product page, so I don\'t have information about other open tabs or their prices to compare.\n\nLooking at the content of this page:\n- It\'s for a product called "Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens Dental Shaping Silicone Tooth Tool"\n- The price shown is $8.99\n- It\'s for a pack of 5 brush pens\n\nThere\'s no clear per unit price listed, but we could calculate it as $8.99 / 5 = $1.80 per pen. However, without other products to compare to, I can\'t determine if this is the lowest.\n\nThe page does have an "Add to Cart" button, which would be relevant to the instruction if this was determined to be the lowest priced item.\n\nRegarding the trajectory summary request:\n- There don\'t seem to be any actions taken yet, just an observation of a product page\n- The goal appears to be price comparison and potentially adding an item to cart, but no steps have been executed toward that goal yet\n\nHmm, I\'m realizing there\'s a mismatch between the instruction and the available information. I can\'t fully execute the instruction without data on other product tabs. I should acknowledge this limitation in my response.\n```\n\nBased on the available information, I can\'t fully execute the instruction to add the product with the lowest per unit price to the cart, as we only have data for one product page. There\'s no evidence of actions taken across multiple tabs or any price comparisons made.\n\nThe observation shows a single product page for "Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens" priced at $8.99 for a pack of 5. While we could calculate a per-unit price of $1.80 per pen, we have no other products to compare this to.\n\nThe overall goal seems to be price comparison across multiple products and adding the cheapest option to the cart. However, without information on other open tabs or products, no significant steps have been taken towards this goal yet. To proceed, we would need observations of other product pages to compare prices and identify the lowest per unit cost item.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens Dental Shaping Silicone Tooth Tool\'\n\tlink [1495] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [1491] \'My Wish List 4 items\'\n\tlink [1497] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [1391] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [1400] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [1504] \'My Cart\'\n\tcombobox [1675] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [2388] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [1678] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [1096]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[1315] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [1311] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [1307] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [1303] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [1299] \'Office Products\'; [1295] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [1291] \'Health & Household\'; [1287] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [1283] \'Electronics\'; [1279] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [1275] \'Video Games\'; [1271] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tlink [1426] \'Home\'\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens Dental Shaping Silicone Tooth Tool\'\n\t\tgeneric [1267] \'Availability\'\n\t\t\ttext \'IN STOCK\'\n\t\ttext \'SKU\'\n\t\ttext \'B07Q1NRQBW\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\tlink [1512] \'Be the first to review this product\'\n\t\ttext \'8.99\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\tspinbutton [1646] \'Qty\' [required: False] [valuemin: 0] [valuemax: 0] [valuetext: ]\n\t\t\t\ttext \'1\'\n\t\t\tbutton [1647] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [1456] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [1457] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [1463] \'Skip to the end of the images gallery\'\n\t\tbutton [2364] \'Previous\'\n\t\tbutton [2366] \'Next\'\n\t\tbutton [2372] \'Previous\'\n\t\tbutton [2374] \'Next\'\n\t\tlink [1467] \'Skip to the beginning of the images gallery\'\n\t\ttablist [1244]\n\t\t\ttab [1468] \'Details\' [selected: False]\n\t\t\t\tlink [1527] \'Details\'\n\t\t\ttabpanel \'Details\'\n\t\t\t\theading \'Product Quick Look\'\n\t\t\t\tListMarker [1253]\n\t\t\t\ttext \'Introduction Thank you for visiting our shop.

The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

The system message will tell it what it can do, instruction is our final goal, interaction history is some finished steps, observation is what we see now, and based on these thing we want gpt model to predict next action to achieve our goal. \n                Here is some action choice and meaning:\n                click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task. Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations. Should focus on helpful not just releted. If any External knowledges are useful, identify which ones have value and explain why they are useful. Finally, output the useful External knowledges in the format [External knowledge0, External knowledge1].'}], 'filter output': "```thinking\nLet me carefully analyze the provided information to determine if any of the External Knowledge examples are helpful for predicting the next action to achieve the given objective.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key elements:\n\nInstruction: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\n\nCurrent Observation: We're on a page showing Tazrigo 5pcs White Dental Resin Brush Pens priced at $8.99 for 5 pcs.\n\nNow, let's examine the External Knowledge examples:\n\nExternal Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 both describe a trajectory where:\n1. The user identified a product (Tazrigo brush pens) with a price of $8.99 for 5 pcs.\n2. They calculated the per unit price as $1.798.\n3. They compared this with other products on different pages.\n4. They concluded this was the lowest per unit price among the options seen.\n5. They added this product to the cart.\n\nExternal Knowledge2 describes a different trajectory involving cell phones and accessories, which is not directly relevant to our current situation.\n\nEvaluation:\nExternal Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 are highly useful for predicting the next action because:\n1. They align perfectly with our current observation (same product, same price).\n2. They provide a calculated per unit price, saving the next model from having to do this calculation.\n3. They indicate that this product has already been determined to have the lowest per unit price after comparison with other options.\n4. They show the final step was to add this product to the cart, which aligns with our instruction.\n\nExternal Knowledge2 is not useful as it deals with a different category of products and doesn't match our current observation.\n\nTherefore, the useful External Knowledge examples are:\n[External Knowledge0, External Knowledge1]\n\nThese examples will help the next model understand that the current product has already been determined to be the best option, and that the next logical action is to add it to the cart.\n```\n\nThe useful External Knowledge examples are [External Knowledge0, External Knowledge1]."}

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

The user\'s objective is to add a white computer desk to their wish list. As there are no computer desks visible on the initial page, the user takes action by typing \\"white computer desk\\" into the search bar.\\n\\nAfter the search action, the page updates to show search results for \\"white computer desk\\". The new page displays a grid view of relevant products, including options like the EMMA + OLIVER White Computer Desk and the Tangkula White Computer Desk. Each product listing includes an image, name, price, and buttons for \\"Add to Cart\\", \\"Add to Wish List\\", and \\"Add to Compare\\". The page also shows filtering options by category and price range, as well as sorting options.\\n\\nThe trajectory ends at this point, with the search results displayed but no further action taken to add a specific desk to the wish list.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to search for a white computer desk on the One Stop Market website. The user starts on the homepage and uses the search functionality to find relevant products. The goal is to locate suitable white computer desk options that can potentially be added to the user\'s wish list.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates how to navigate from a general product page to specific search results for a desired item. It showcases the website\'s search capabilities and how the results are presented, including product images, names, prices, and action buttons for each item. The trajectory also reveals the website\'s organization of search results, including options for view type (grid or list), sorting, and filtering by category.\\n\\nWhile the ultimate objective of adding a desk to the wish list is not completed in this trajectory, it sets the stage for the next steps, which would likely involve reviewing the search results, selecting a specific desk, and using the \\"Add to Wish List\\" button for the chosen item.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, I evaluate the trajectory and instruction as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction to search for a white computer desk, although it doesn\'t complete the full task of adding it to the wish list.\\n2. Coherence: The actions taken are logical and build upon each other, starting from the homepage and progressing to search results.\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of searching for a product on an e-commerce website.\\n4. Reasonable: The approach taken is straightforward and efficient for finding white computer desk options.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\":

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR REFERENCE: this is some example (or empty) you can refer to to complete the task (please do not mix the ids and descriptions and urls in the examples with our current webpage observation. In each example, first come observation and objective, then come the action and reason, then come next observation, and so on. But we are not sure wether these example is good or bad, learn from it and you need to make your own action):[[{"External Knowledge0": "\nSummarized Instructions:\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\nThe trajectory begins with the user on a webpage displaying meat substitute products. The page shows four items within the specified price range of $100 to $200. Among these, only one product, \"Beyond Meat Beef Beefy Crumble,\" has a visible rating (50%) and reviews (8). \n\nThe user then clicks the \"Add to Cart\" button for this product, which is priced at $108.27. This action is consistent with the objective of buying the highest-rated product within the given budget.\n\nAfter the action, the page updates to show a confirmation message: \"You added Beyond Meat Beef Beefy Crumble, 5 Pound -- 2 per case. to your shopping cart.\" The cart icon in the header also updates to show \"My Cart 3 3items,\" indicating that the product has been successfully added to the cart.\n\nThe rest of the page content remains largely the same, with the \"Add to Cart\" button for the selected product now in focus, suggesting the action was completed successfully.\n\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to select and purchase a meat substitute product from an online grocery store, focusing on finding the highest-rated option within a specific price range. The user is tasked with browsing a category page for meat substitutes, comparing the available products, and selecting the one that best meets the criteria of having the highest rating while staying within a budget of $100 to $200.\n\nThe user is expected to carefully examine the product listings, paying attention to prices, ratings, and reviews. Once the most suitable product is identified, the user should add it to their shopping cart. This process involves analyzing the available information, making a decision based on the given criteria, and taking action to initiate the purchase by adding the chosen item to the cart.\n\nThe trajectory demonstrates the user's ability to navigate an e-commerce website, interpret product information, and make a purchase decision based on specific parameters. It also shows the user's interaction with the website's interface to complete the task of adding an item to the shopping cart.\n\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nEvaluation:\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by selecting and adding to cart the only rated product within the specified price range.\n2. Coherence: The action of clicking \"Add to Cart\" logically follows the observation of product details and ratings.\n3. Natural: The interaction mimics a typical online shopping experience, making it natural.\n4. Reasonable: The trajectory efficiently accomplishes the task by directly selecting the most suitable product based on the given criteria.\n\n**yes**\n\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"heap\",\n    \"objective\": \"Buy the highest rated product from the meat substitute category within a budget between 100 and 200.\",\n    \"url\": \"https://webarena-env-shopping.awsdev.asapp.com/\",\n    \"steps\": [\n        {\n            \"observation\": \"Tab 0 (current): Meat Substitutes -

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Okay, let's analyze the current situation and plan our next move:

1. We're now on the home page of One Stop Market, which shows a variety of products. This is good because it allows us to compare different items and their prices.

2. Our objective is to find the product with the lowest per unit price and add it to the cart. To do this effectively, we need to:
   a) Gather information on all available products
   b) Calculate the per unit price for each product
   c) Compare the per unit prices
   d) Add the cheapest one to the cart

3. The current page shows 12 products out of a total of 24. We can see there's a "Page 2" link, so we'll need to check that page as well for a complete comparison.

4. For each product, we need to note:
   - Product name
   - Total price
   - Quantity or volume (to calculate per unit price)

5. Some challenges I notice:
   - Not all products show their quantity/volume in the title
   - We might need to click into individual product pages for more details
   - We need to be careful about different units (oz, lbs, count, etc.)

6. Let's start by gathering info on the visible products:

   1. Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit: $19.99 for 34 oz (2 pack of 17 oz)
   2. V8 Energy Drink: $14.47 for 24 cans (8 oz each)
   3. Elmwood Inn Fine Teas: $19.36 for 16 oz
   4. Belle Of The Ball Sprinkle Mix: $23.50 for 8 oz
   5. So Delicious CocoWhip Light: $15.62 for 9 oz
   6. Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder: $34.00 for 1000g (2 x 500g)
   7. Q Mixers Ginger Ale: $68.50 for 24 bottles (6.7 fl oz each)
   8. Stove Top Turkey Stuffing Mix: $8.49 for 24 oz (2 x 12 oz)
   9. Briess DME - Pilsen Light: $12.99 for 1 lb
   10. Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning: $7.92 for 14 oz
   11. Lobster Cobbler Pot Pie: $411.76 for 8 trays (no weight given)
   12. Crunchy Rice Rollers: $11.50 for 4 packs (3.5 oz each)

7. From this initial data, the Stove Top Turkey Stuffing Mix seems to have the lowest per-unit price at about $0.35 per oz. However, we still need to check the second page before making a final decision.

Next steps:
1. Navigate to the second page to gather information on the remaining products.
2. After collecting all data, calculate and compare per unit prices.
3. Add the cheapest product to the cart.

Let's proceed by going to the second page.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
In the previous step, we navigated from a specific product page (Ciclon Energy Drink) to the home page of One Stop Market. The home page displays various products, allowing us to start comparing prices.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page is the home page of One Stop Market, displaying 12 out of 24 total products. Each product listing includes the product name, price, and sometimes rating information. There's a pagination section at the bottom, indicating there's a second page with more products.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: To gather information on all available products and find the lowest per unit price, we need to view the second page of products.
- action: click [4474]

- reason: We could start adding the cheapest product from this page to the cart, but we might miss a better deal on the second page.
- action: click [5244]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
4474, 4057, 5244, 5235, 5226, 5218, 5209, 5200, 5191, 5182

RAG LOG:
{'id': ['instructions_506_obs5_obs6'], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze this observation of a product listing page to determine the key steps and overall purpose...\n\nThe page appears to be an e-commerce website called "One Stop Market" showing a variety of food and beverage products. I see a list of 12 items displayed with details like product name, price, rating, and "Add to Cart" buttons.\n\nThe instruction asks to add the product with the lowest per unit price to the cart. To accomplish this, I would need to:\n\n1. Identify all the products and their prices\n2. Calculate the per unit price for each (if unit sizes are provided)\n3. Compare to find the lowest per unit price\n4. Click the "Add to Cart" button for that item\n\nHowever, I don\'t see clear unit sizes listed for most products, which makes it difficult to accurately calculate per unit prices. Without that information, I can only go by the total price shown.\n\nLooking at the total prices, the lowest priced item appears to be:\n"Tony Chachere\'s More Spice Creole Seasoning - 14 oz" at $7.92\n\nSo the key action would be to click the "Add to Cart" button (element [5260]) for this item.\n\nThe higher-level purpose seems to be helping the user find the best value item and add it to their cart for purchase. This aligns with typical e-commerce goals of price comparison shopping and facilitating purchases.\n\nHowever, I should note that without full per unit pricing, we can\'t be certain this is truly the lowest cost per unit. A larger package of something else could potentially be a better value. We\'re working with limited information here.\n```\n\nBased on the available information, the significant steps in this trajectory would be:\n\n1. Scan the product listings to identify prices\n2. Locate the item with the lowest total price: "Tony Chachere\'s More Spice Creole Seasoning - 14 oz" at $7.92\n3. Click the "Add to Cart" button for this item\n\nThe higher-level purpose of these actions appears to be finding the most affordable product option and adding it to the shopping cart, likely with the goal of making a cost-effective purchase. However, it\'s important to note that without clear per unit pricing information, we cannot definitively determine which product offers the best value per unit.', 'external knowledge': '[{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins with the user on a webpage displaying meat substitute products. The page shows four items within the specified price range of $100 to $200. Among these, only one product, \\"Beyond Meat Beef Beefy Crumble,\\" has a visible rating (50%) and reviews (8). \\n\\nThe user then clicks the \\"Add to Cart\\" button for this product, which is priced at $108.27. This action is consistent with the objective of buying the highest-rated product within the given budget.\\n\\nAfter the action, the page updates to show a confirmation message: \\"You added Beyond Meat Beef Beefy Crumble, 5 Pound -- 2 per case. to your shopping cart.\\" The cart icon in the header also updates to show \\"My Cart 3 3items,\\" indicating that the product has been successfully added to the cart.\\n\\nThe rest of the page content remains largely the same, with the \\"Add to Cart\\" button for the selected product now in focus, suggesting the action was completed successfully.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to select and purchase a meat substitute product from an online grocery store, focusing on finding the highest-rated option within a specific price range. The user is tasked with browsing a category page for meat substitutes, comparing the available products, and selecting the one that best meets the criteria of having the highest rating while staying within a budget of $100 to $200.\\n\\nThe user is expected to carefully examine the product listings, paying attention to prices, ratings, and reviews. Once the most suitable product is identified, the user should add it to their shopping cart. This process involves analyzing the available information, making a decision based on the given criteria, and taking action to initiate the purchase by adding the chosen item to the cart.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates the user\'s ability to navigate an e-commerce website, interpret product information, and make a purchase decision based on specific parameters. It also shows the user\'s interaction with the website\'s interface to complete the task of adding an item to the shopping cart.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by selecting and adding to cart the only rated product within the specified price range.\\n2. Coherence: The action of clicking \\"Add to Cart\\" logically follows the observation of product details and ratings.\\n3. Natural: The interaction mimics a typical online shopping experience, making it natural.\\n4. Reasonable: The trajectory efficiently accomplishes the task by directly selecting the most suitable product based on the given criteria.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Buy the highest rated product from the meat substitute category within a budget between 100 and 200.\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-shopping.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Meat Substitutes -

The page shows four items within the specified price range of $100 to $200. Among these, only one product, \\"Beyond Meat Beef Beefy Crumble,\\" has a visible rating (50%) and reviews (8). \\n\\nThe user then clicks the \\"Add to Cart\\" button for this product, which is priced at $108.27. This action is consistent with the objective of buying the highest-rated product within the given budget.\\n\\nAfter the action, the page updates to show a confirmation message: \\"You added Beyond Meat Beef Beefy Crumble, 5 Pound -- 2 per case. to your shopping cart.\\" The cart icon in the header also updates to show \\"My Cart 3 3items,\\" indicating that the product has been successfully added to the cart.\\n\\nThe rest of the page content remains largely the same, with the \\"Add to Cart\\" button for the selected product now in focus, suggesting the action was completed successfully.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to select and purchase a meat substitute product from an online grocery store, focusing on finding the highest-rated option within a specific price range. The user is tasked with browsing a category page for meat substitutes, comparing the available products, and selecting the one that best meets the criteria of having the highest rating while staying within a budget of $100 to $200.\\n\\nThe user is expected to carefully examine the product listings, paying attention to prices, ratings, and reviews. Once the most suitable product is identified, the user should add it to their shopping cart. This process involves analyzing the available information, making a decision based on the given criteria, and taking action to initiate the purchase by adding the chosen item to the cart.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates the user\'s ability to navigate an e-commerce website, interpret product information, and make a purchase decision based on specific parameters. It also shows the user\'s interaction with the website\'s interface to complete the task of adding an item to the shopping cart.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by selecting and adding to cart the only rated product within the specified price range.\\n2. Coherence: The action of clicking \\"Add to Cart\\" logically follows the observation of product details and ratings.\\n3. Natural: The interaction mimics a typical online shopping experience, making it natural.\\n4.

Add DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit to my wish list

STEP:

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

Alright, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action to add the specified lingerie item to the wish list.

First, I'll rephrase the task: We need to add the "DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit" to the wish list.

Looking at the observation, I can see that we've successfully searched for the item and it appears in the search results. This is great progress. Now, we need to find the specific item and add it to the wish list.

Let's break this down:

1. The exact item we're looking for is present in the search results. It's listed as:
   "DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit"

2. Each item in the search results has an "Add to Wish List" button associated with it.

3. The "Add to Wish List" button for our target item has the ID [5242].

Given this information, the most straightforward action would be to click the "Add to Wish List" button for our target item. This should add the item to the wish list, completing our objective.

However, let's also consider potential follow-up steps:

1. We might want to verify that the item was successfully added to the wish list.
2. If the addition isn't confirmed immediately, we might need to navigate to the wish list to check.

For now, let's focus on the primary action of adding the item to the wish list. We can address any follow-up steps if needed based on the next observation.

I'm confident that clicking the "Add to Wish List" button is the correct action at this point. It directly addresses our objective and should move us towards completing the task.
```

{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nOkay, let\'s analyze this interaction and trajectory:\n\nFirst, I\'ll summarize the key steps and actions I see:\n\n1. The user is on a search results page for "DkRgVNY Lace Bodysuit"\n2. There\'s a list of search results showing various lingerie products\n3. One specific item is mentioned in the instruction: "DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit"\n4. The instruction is to add this item to the wish list\n5. In the observations, we can see this exact item in the search results\n6. There\'s a "Add to Wish List" button associated with this item\n7. The user\'s wish list already contains 14 items, as shown in the header\n\nNow, looking at the higher-level purpose:\n\nThe goal here seems to be for the user to save a specific lingerie item they\'re interested in for future reference or purchase. They\'re using the e-commerce site\'s wish list feature to keep track of desired items without immediately buying them.\n\nThis fits into a common online shopping behavior where users browse, find items they like, and save them to consider or compare later. The wish list serves as a personalized collection of potential future purchases.\n\nThe trajectory shows the user has successfully found the item they want through a search, and now wants to save it alongside other items they\'re considering. This suggests they\'re in a browsing and decision-making phase of their shopping journey, not yet ready to make a purchase but actively curating options.\n```\n\nBased on the interaction and observations, here\'s a summary:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1.

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123].

By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [5244]
|	reason for action [0]:
We could start adding the cheapest product from this page to the cart, but we might miss a better deal on the second page.

|	action [1]:
click [4474]
|	reason for action [1]:
To gather information on all available products and find the lowest per unit price, we need to view the second page of products.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's assess our progress and the available actions...

First, I need to review why we haven't fulfilled our objective yet. We've only seen one page of products, and there's clearly a second page we haven't explored. We can't be sure we've found the lowest per unit price without seeing all options.

Now, looking at the current state and our options:

Action 0 suggests adding the cheapest product we've seen so far to the cart. That's tempting, but premature. We don't know if there's a better deal on the next page. Plus, we haven't calculated per unit prices yet - we only see total prices.

Action 1 proposes going to the second page of products. This seems more aligned with our goal of finding the lowest per unit price across all options.

Let's break this down more systematically:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[0] [Clicked "Home" to view product listings] [Only viewed first page of products] [Need to see all products to compare prices]
	[N/A] [Haven't calculated per unit prices yet] [Need to gather all product information first]
	[N/A] [Haven't added any product to cart] [Need to identify lowest per unit price before adding to cart]

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Medium value - adds a product to cart, which is part of our goal] [High risk - may not be the lowest per unit price product] [Best case: We accidentally choose the lowest per unit price product] [Worst case: We add a higher-priced product and fail to meet our objective]
- action [1]: [High value - allows us to view more products and gather more information] [Low risk - doesn't commit us to any purchase, just provides more data] [Best case: We find a product with an even lower per unit price on the second page] [Worst case: We don't find a better deal, but we've ensured we've seen all options]

Considering these assessments, action [1] clearly aligns better with our objective. It allows us to gather all necessary information before making a decision, reducing the risk of choosing a suboptimal product.

Therefore, I'll select action [1] to view the second page of products. This is the most logical next step in finding the product with the lowest per unit price across all available options.
```

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's analyze the current situation and figure out the best course of action to add the specific slippers to the wish list.

First, I need to rephrase what we're trying to do: We want to add "Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes" to the wish list.

Looking at the search results, I can see that our search query has brought up some relevant items. This is good progress. Now, let's scan through the results to find our exact item.

Ah! I see it right at the top of the search results. Element [6816] is a link with the exact title we're looking for: "Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes". This is precisely the item we want to add to the wish list.

Right below this link, I can see element [5231] which is a button labeled "Add to Wish List". This is exactly what we need to complete our task.

Given this information, the most straightforward action would be to click on the "Add to Wish List" button for our desired item. This should add the slippers to the wish list, completing our objective.

However, let's also consider a potential alternative approach. We could click on the product link first to view more details, and then add it to the wish list from the product page. But since we're certain this is the exact item we want, and we have a direct "Add to Wish List" button available, the simpler approach seems more efficient.

Now, let's prepare our action. We'll click on the "Add to Wish List" button, which should add our item to the wish list. After this action, we should verify that the item has been added successfully, possibly by checking the "My Wish List" section or looking for a confirmation message.

I'm confident this action will complete our task, but if for some reason it doesn't work as expected, we might need to explore the product page or check if there are any login requirements for adding items to the wish list.

Let's proceed with clicking the "Add to Wish List" button.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
In the previous step, we searched for "Light blue summer low heel slippers women" which brought us to the current search results page.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page shows search results for "Light blue summer low heel slippers women". The exact item we're looking for, "Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes", is listed as the first search result. There's an "Add to Wish List" button (element [5231]) associated with this item.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: The "Add to Wish List" button for our desired item is directly available, which should add the item to the wish list and complete our task.
- action: click [5231]

- reason: We could first click on the product link to view more details before adding it to the wish list, but this seems unnecessary given the direct "Add to Wish List" button.
- action: click [6816]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
5231, 6816, 5604, 6088

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nAlright, let\'s analyze this trajectory and summarize the key actions and overall purpose:\n\nFirst, I need to understand what\'s happening here. This seems to be a web page for an online store, specifically showing search results for "Light blue summer low heel slippers women". The user, Emma Lopez, is logged in and viewing these results.\n\nNow, let\'s break down the significant steps or actions:\n\n1. The user has searched for "Light blue summer low heel slippers women"\n2. The search results are displayed, showing various sandals and slippers\n3. Each product has options to add to cart, wish list, or compare\n4. There\'s a specific product mentioned in the instruction: "Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes"\n5. This specific product is already in the user\'s wish list, as evidenced by it being listed under "My Wish List"\n\nThe instruction given is to add this specific product to the wish list. However, it\'s already there, which is interesting.\n\nAs for the higher-level abstraction of the purpose or goal:\n\nThe overall purpose seems to be managing a wish list for future purchases. The user has searched for a specific type of footwear, likely with the intention of finding and saving desirable items for later consideration or purchase. The wish list serves as a tool for the user to keep track of items they\'re interested in but not ready to buy immediately.\n\nThe fact that the item is already in the wish list suggests that either:\n1. The user forgot they had already added it\n2. There\'s a desire to ensure it\'s on the list (maybe they thought they removed it earlier)\n3. Or possibly, this is a test or verification action to check if the item is indeed on the wish list\n\nIn any case, the core goal appears to be curating a personalized collection of desired products for future reference or purchase.\n```\n\nBased on the trajectory, here\'s a brief summary of the significant steps and the overall purpose:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. User searched for "Light blue summer low heel slippers women"\n2. Search results displayed various sandals and slippers\n3. A specific product ("Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers...") was highlighted\n4. This product was already present in the user\'s wish list\n\nOverall purpose:\nThe trajectory shows actions related to managing a wish list for future purchases. The user searched for a specific type of footwear, likely intending to find and save desirable items for later consideration. The goal appears to be curating a personalized collection of desired products, specifically focusing on adding or verifying the presence of a particular pair of light blue summer slippers in the wish list.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes to my wish list\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea "Search results for: \'Light blue summer low heel slippers women\'"\n\tlink [5608] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [5604] \'My Wish List 14 items\'\n\tlink [5610] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [5539] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [5548] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [5617] \'My Cart 10 10items\'\n\tcombobox [6088] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\t\ttext \'Light blue summer low heel slippers women\'\n\tlink [6810] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [6091] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [4693]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[5463] \'Beauty & Personal Care\';

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task. Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations. Should focus on helpful not just releted. If any External knowledges are useful, identify which ones have value and explain why they are useful. Finally, output the useful External knowledges in the format [External knowledge0, External knowledge1].'}], 'filter output': '```thinking\nLet me carefully analyze the provided information and evaluate the usefulness of the External knowledge for predicting the next action:\n\nThe instruction is to add "Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes" to the wish list.\n\nLooking at the current observation, we can see that the user is already on the "My Wish List" page, and there\'s an alert message stating:\n"Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes has been added to your Wish List."\n\nThis indicates that the task has already been completed successfully.\n\nNow, let\'s evaluate the External knowledge:\n\nExternal Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 both describe similar trajectories where the user adds the specified product to their wish list. These are indeed relevant to the task at hand.\n\nExternal Knowledge2, however, describes adding a different product (Sceptre E195BD-SRR 19-Inch 720P LED TV) to the wish list, which is not relevant to our specific instruction.\n\nIn terms of usefulness for predicting the next action:\n\nExternal Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 are potentially useful because they show the complete process of adding the exact item we\'re interested in to the wish list. They demonstrate that after successfully adding the item, the correct action is to stop, as the objective has been achieved.\n\nHowever, given that our current observation already shows that the item has been added to the wish list, these external knowledge examples, while relevant, don\'t provide additional information that would change the next action prediction.\n\nExternal Knowledge2 is not useful for our specific task, as it deals with a different product.\n\nIn conclusion, while External Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 are relevant, they don\'t provide additional useful information beyond what we can already see in the current observation. The most appropriate action can be determined directly from the current observation without relying on the external knowledge.\n\nTherefore, I would not consider any of the External knowledge pieces as particularly useful for predicting the next action in this specific situation.\n```\n\nBased on this analysis, I don\'t find any of the External knowledge pieces to be particularly useful for predicting the next action in this specific situation. The current observation already provides all the necessary information to determine that the task has been completed successfully.'}

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [6816]
|	reason for action [0]:
We could first click on the product link to view more details before adding it to the wish list, but this seems unnecessary given the direct "Add to Wish List" button.

|	action [1]:
click [5231]
|	reason for action [1]:
The "Add to Wish List" button for our desired item is directly available, which should add the item to the wish list and complete our task.


RESPONSE:
Here is my analysis and action selection:

```thinking
Alright, let's carefully assess the situation and our options...

First, I need to review our progress and why we haven't fully achieved the objective yet:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[0] [We successfully searched for the product] [The search was successful, but we haven't added the item to the wish list yet]

Now, let's look at our action choices:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: click [6816] 
[Value: Moderate. It would allow us to view more details about the product, which could be useful to confirm it's exactly what we want.]
[Risk: Low. There's little risk in viewing more details, but it's an extra step that may not be necessary.]
[Best case: We confirm it's the exact product we want before adding to wish list]
[Worst case: We waste time on an unnecessary step, since we already found the correct product]

- action [1]: click [5231] 
[Value: High. This action directly adds the item to the wish list, which is our main objective.]
[Risk: Very low. The product title matches exactly what we're looking for, so this is almost certainly the correct item.]
[Best case: The item is added to the wish list, completing our objective efficiently]
[Worst case: The item is added to the wish list but turns out to be slightly different than expected (highly unlikely given the exact title match)]

Analyzing these options, I can see that action [1] is clearly the most direct and efficient way to achieve our objective. The product title "Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes" matches our target item exactly, so there's no need for the extra step of viewing more details.

By clicking the "Add to Wish List" button, we should complete our task in one simple action. This is the most valuable action with the least risk, as it directly fulfills our objective without any unnecessary steps.

Therefore, I'm confident that selecting action [1] is the best choice to maximize our objective fulfillment reward.
```

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's carefully analyze the current situation and the task at hand.

First, I'll rephrase the human's request to ensure I understand it correctly:
The objective is to add the "HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits" to the wish list.

Now, looking at the current observation, I see we're on a search results page after searching for "HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits". This is good progress, as we've narrowed down the products to potentially include our target item.

Scanning through the search results, I notice something interesting:
There's an exact match for our target product:
link [6829] 'HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits'

This is exactly what we're looking for! And conveniently, right next to it, there's a button to add it to the wish list:
button [5238] 'Add to Wish List'

This seems like the perfect action to take. By clicking this button, we should be able to add the item to the wish list, which is our main objective.

However, before I commit to this action, let me double-check if there's anything else I should consider:

1. Is there any confirmation needed after clicking "Add to Wish List"? 
   - I don't see any indication of this, so it's likely a direct action.

2. Do we need to verify if the item was added successfully? 
   - This might be a good idea, but let's first perform the add action.

3. Are there any alternative methods to add to the wish list?
   - None that I can see which are as direct as this button.

4. Is there any reason not to use this button?
   - I can't think of any. It's specifically designed for our purpose.

Given this analysis, I believe the best course of action is to click the "Add to Wish List" button for our target item. This should directly accomplish our objective.

After we perform this action, we should look for confirmation that the item was added successfully. This might appear as a pop-up message, or we might need to check the wish list itself.

Alright, let's proceed with the action.
```

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nLet me analyze the trajectory and summarize the key actions and overall purpose:\n\nHmm, looking at the observations, it seems the user is on an e-commerce website, specifically on a search results page for "HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits".

The user was given an instruction to add a specific product to their wish list: "HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits"\n\nInterestingly, when I look at the "My Wish List" section at the bottom of the page, I notice this exact item is already listed there:\n\n"link [7004] \'HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits\'"\n\nThis suggests that the action of adding the item to the wish list has already been completed, even though we don\'t see the actual action in the trajectory.\n\nThe higher-level purpose of this trajectory seems to be managing the user\'s wish list on an e-commerce platform. Specifically, the goal was to add a particular Hawaiian outfit set to the wish list for potential future purchase.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that while the instruction was to add the item, it appears this had already been done by the time we see this snapshot of the page.

--------------------------------JUDGE--------------------------------
INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are a seasoned web navigator. You now assess the value and risk of serveral web navigation actions based on the objective, the previous interaction history and the web's current state. Then, you select the action with the most value and least risk with which you would earn the maximum objective fulfillment reward in the future.

Adhere to the following output format:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
Review critically why the plans have not been fulfilled or the objective achieved. Justify your assessment with detailed evidence drawn from the objective, observations, and actions taken. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

RESPONSE:

Alright, let's carefully analyze the current situation and assess our options:

First, I need to review our objective and progress...

Our goal is to add the "HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits" to the wish list. We've made good progress - we've successfully searched for the item and it's now visible on the page.

Now, let's assess our plan progress:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[step_0] [Searched for "HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits"] [Successfully found the target item on the search results page]

We've completed the first crucial step of finding the item. Now we need to add it to the wish list.

Let's evaluate our action options:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: click [5617] 'My Wish List 14 items'
  [Value: Low. This action would show us the current wish list, but doesn't directly contribute to our goal.]
  [Risk: Low. No significant risk, but it's an unnecessary step that doesn't move us closer to our objective.]
  [Best case: We see the current wish list contents, which might be interesting but not essential.]
  [Worst case: We navigate away from the page with our target item, requiring us to search again.]

- action [1]: click [5238] 'Add to Wish List'
  [Value: High. This action directly fulfills our objective of adding the item to the wish list.]
  [Risk: Very low. This is exactly the action we need to take to accomplish our goal.]
  [Best case: The item is successfully added to the wish list, completing our objective.]
  [Worst case: There might be an error in adding the item, but we'd likely get feedback and could try again.]

Comparing these options, action [1] is clearly the better choice. It directly addresses our objective with minimal risk and maximum value. Clicking "Add to Wish List" for our target item is the most efficient and effective way to complete our task.

ACTION SELECTION:
1
```

I select action 1: click the "Add to Wish List" button for our target item. This action directly fulfills our objective of adding the HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set to the wish list.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

The observation shows that the Sceptre E195BD-SRR 19-Inch 720P LED TV, True Black (2017) has been successfully added to the user's wish list. This is evident from the alert message displayed at the top of the page. The wish list contains 11 items in total, with the newly added TV being one of them. The page displays various other items in the wish list, including laundry detergent, clothing items, and personal care products. Each item in the list has options to add comments, adjust quantity, add to cart, edit, or remove the item. The user interface also provides navigation options for account management, shopping categories, and pagination for the wish list items. After observing this, the action taken is to stop, as the objective of adding a product to the wish list has already been accomplished.\n\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this trajectory was to add a specific product, namely the Sceptre E195BD-SRR 19-Inch 720P LED TV, True Black (2017), to the user's wish list on an online shopping platform. The task began with the user already on the \"My Wish List\" page, where they could view their current list of saved items. The objective was successfully completed before any additional actions were needed, as evidenced by the alert message confirming the addition of the TV to the wish list.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine our next steps:

1. Rephrasing the human message: The objective is to add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts to the wish list.

2. Initial impressions: We've successfully added the item to the wish list. The alert message confirms this, and the wish list now shows 5 items (increased from 4 previously).

3. Broader context: We're on an e-commerce platform, and we've just completed an action to add an item to the wish list.

4. Known elements: The item has been added to the wish list. Unknown elements: Whether the quantity is correct (we need 2, but by default it might have added only 1).

5. The human might be asking this to create a wish list for future purchases or to share with others.

6. Relevant knowledge: E-commerce platforms often allow users to adjust quantities of items in wish lists.

7. Potential ambiguity: We need to verify if the quantity added is correct.

Now, let's explore the problem space:

1. Core components: 
   - Item added successfully
   - Quantity needs to be 2
   - Wish list management

2. Requirements:
   - Verify quantity
   - Adjust quantity if necessary

3. Constraints: We can only use the available interface elements.

4. A successful response would confirm that 2 units of the item are in the wish list.

5. We need to know how to check and adjust quantities in the wish list.

Let's generate multiple hypotheses:

1. The quantity might already be set to 2 by default.
2. We might need to adjust the quantity manually.
3. There might be a separate process for changing quantities in the wish list.

Now, let's start our discovery process:

1. The item is indeed in the wish list, as we can see "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts" listed.
2. There's a spinbutton labeled 'Qty' associated with this item.
3. The current quantity seems to be set to 1, as indicated by the text '1' under the spinbutton.
4. We need to adjust this quantity to 2.

Let's test our understanding:

1. We assumed correctly that we'd need to adjust the quantity.
2. The interface provides a direct way to do this via the spinbutton.

Now, let's synthesize this information:

We need to use the spinbutton to increase the quantity from 1 to 2. After that, we should update the wish list to ensure the change is saved.

Recognizing patterns:

This follows a common e-commerce pattern of allowing quantity adjustments in wish lists or shopping carts.

Tracking progress:

We've added the item successfully and identified how to adjust the quantity. We just need to make this adjustment and save the changes.

Let's verify our approach:

1. Increasing the quantity using the spinbutton is logical and matches the interface design.
2. The "Update Wish List" button suggests we need to confirm changes after making adjustments.

Quality control:

This approach directly addresses the objective, uses the provided interface elements, and follows a logical sequence of actions.

Now, let's prepare our response:
```

RAG LOG:
{'id': ['instructions_518_obs1_obs2'], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze the interaction history and observations to understand what happened here...\n\nThe key elements I\'m seeing:\n- There\'s a "My Wish List" page showing 5 items\n- An alert message saying "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts has been added to your Wish List"\n- The item "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts" is indeed listed as one of the 5 items on the wish list\n\nSo it seems the main action that occurred was adding this Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots item to the wish list.

Specifically, it shows the user adding a desired product to their wish list for future reference or purchase. This is a common feature on shopping sites to allow users to save items they\'re interested in without immediately purchasing them.\n\nSo in summary:\n1. The main action was adding the Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots to the wish list\n2. The overall goal was to save an item of interest for potential future purchase\n\nThat seems to capture the key points of what occurred in this interaction. Let me formulate a concise response based on this analysis...\n```\n\nBased on the observations, here\'s a summary of the trajectory:\n\nSignificant step:\n- Added "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts" to the wish list\n\nHigher-level purpose:\nThe goal of this action was to save an item of interest to the user\'s wish list on an e-commerce platform, allowing them to easily find and potentially purchase it later.', 'external knowledge': '[{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins with the user already on the \\"My Wish List\\" page of an online shopping website.

The page displays various other items in the wish list, including laundry detergent, clothing items, and personal care products. Each item in the list has options to add comments, adjust quantity, add to cart, edit, or remove the item. The user interface also provides navigation options for account management, shopping categories, and pagination for the wish list items. After observing this, the action taken is to stop, as the objective of adding a product to the wish list has already been accomplished.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory was to add a specific product, namely the Sceptre E195BD-SRR 19-Inch 720P LED TV, True Black (2017), to the user\'s wish list on an online shopping platform.

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task. Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations.

The key points are:\n- An alert message indicates "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts has been added to your Wish List."\n- The wish list contains 11 items total\n- The newly added item is visible in the wish list\n\nExternal Knowledge:\n1. External Knowledge0: This contains information about Xbox controllers released between 2020-2021. It\'s not relevant to the current task of adding Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots to a wish list.\n\n2. External Knowledge1: This is also about Xbox controllers and not relevant to the current task.\n\n3. External Knowledge2: This provides a summary of a trajectory where a Sceptre TV was added to a wish list. While it\'s not directly about Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots, it does describe a similar process of adding an item to a wish list. This could be somewhat useful in understanding the general workflow of adding items to a wish list on this website.\n\nEvaluation:\nExternal Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 are not useful for predicting the next action in this scenario. They are about Xbox controllers, which is unrelated to the current task.\n\nExternal Knowledge2, while not directly about the specific product we\'re interested in, does provide some insight into the process of adding items to a wish list on this website. It shows that when an item is successfully added to the wish list, an alert message appears confirming the addition, and the item becomes visible in the wish list. This aligns with what we see in our current observation.\n\nGiven that our observation already shows the Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots have been added to the wish list (as evidenced by the alert message and the item\'s presence in the list), External Knowledge2 could be marginally useful in confirming that the task has already been completed successfully.\n\nUseful External knowledge: [External knowledge2]\n\nReason: External knowledge2 provides context about how the website behaves when an item is successfully added to the wish list, which aligns with our current observation and could help confirm that the task has been completed.\n```\n\nThe useful External knowledge is [External knowledge2].'}

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [8252]
|	reason for action [0]:
After adjusting the quantity, we need to save the changes to the wish list.

|	action [1]:
click [9315]
|	reason for action [1]:
We need to increase the quantity of the item from 1 to 2 as per the objective.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's carefully analyze the current situation and our progress towards the objective.

First, I'll review what we've accomplished so far:
We successfully searched for the "Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots" and found the exact item we were looking for: "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts". We then clicked the "Add to Wish List" button for this item.

Now, looking at the current observation, I see several important things:
1. The page title is "My Wish List", indicating we're on the correct page.
2. There's an alert message saying "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts has been added to your Wish List."
3. The "My Wish List" link at the top now shows "5 items" instead of the previous "4 items".
4. In the list of items, I can see our target item: "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts".

These observations confirm that we've successfully added the item to the wish list. However, our objective specifically states "Add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots", and currently, the quantity is set to 1 by default.

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[0, 1] [Item successfully added to wish list] [Quantity not yet set to 2]

The plan has been partially successful. We've added the correct item to the wish list, but we haven't yet set the quantity to 2.

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: click [8252] (Update Wish List button)
[Low value, Low risk] This action would update the wish list, but we haven't made any changes yet, so it's not necessary at this point. [Best case: No change to current state] [Worst case: Unnecessary action that doesn't progress towards our goal]

- action [1]: click [9315] (Quantity spinbutton for our item)
[High value, Low risk] This action allows us to adjust the quantity of the item in our wish list, which is exactly what we need to do to complete our objective. [Best case: We can increase the quantity to 2, fulfilling our objective] [Worst case: The spinbutton might not respond to clicks and we'd need to find another way to adjust the quantity]

ACTION SELECTION:
1

I've chosen action 1, which is to click the quantity spinbutton for our item. This is the most direct way to increase the quantity from 1 to 2, which is the final step we need to complete our objective. After adjusting the quantity, we'll need to update the wish list to save the changes, but that will be our next step after confirming we can successfully change the quantity.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website. We give you the right website, please just explore. This task must 100% can be completed without requesting external information or human assistance. Required information should be obtained through your own actions. Keep exploring different approaches until you succeed - never give up or wait for human input.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR REFERENCE: this is some example (or empty) you can refer to to complete the task (please do not mix the ids and descriptions and urls in the examples with our current webpage observation. In each example, first come observation and objective, then come the action and reason, then come next observation, and so on. But we are not sure wether these example is good or bad, learn from it and you need to make your own action):[[{"External Knowledge0": "\nSummarized Instructions:\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\nThe trajectory begins on a webpage displaying cell phones and accessories. The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \"Dilwe1 12'' Phone Screen Magnifier\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \"Add to Cart\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn't appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\n\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they've made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\n\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nEvaluation:\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn't successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don't contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\n\n**yes**\n\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"heap\",\n    \"objective\": \"Add the product

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action to find the product with the lowest per unit price across all open tabs.

First, I'll summarize what we've done so far:
1. We started on a page for Ciclon Energy Drink
2. We navigated to the home page
3. We viewed the first page of products
4. Now we're on the second page of products

The current observation shows we're on the second page of products on the One Stop Market website. We have 12 products displayed here, and we know there were 12 on the previous page, for a total of 24 products.

To find the lowest per unit price, we need to:
1. Gather all the price information from both pages
2. Calculate the per unit price for each product (if unit information is available)
3. Compare all the per unit prices

However, there's a challenge here. We don't have the information from the first page anymore, and we can't directly access other tabs. This means we can't compare prices across all open tabs as required by the objective.

Given these limitations, we have a few options:

1. Go back to the first page and start noting down prices, then return to this page and compare all 24 products.
2. Assume that the lowest priced item on this page is the overall lowest and add it to the cart.
3. Look for a way to sort products by price, which might help us find the lowest priced item more easily.

Option 1 is the most thorough but time-consuming. Option 2 is quick but might not give us the correct answer. Option 3 could be efficient if such a feature exists.

Let's look for a sorting option. I see a "Sort By" combobox with ID [5429] which might allow us to sort by price.

I think the best action right now is to try using this sorting feature to arrange products by price, which should help us identify the lowest priced item more easily.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
We started on a product page, navigated to the home page, viewed the first page of products, and are now on the second page of products. We have not yet identified the lowest priced item or added anything to the cart.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page displays 12 products (items 13 to 24 out of 24 total) on the One Stop Market website. Each product listing includes the product name, price, and sometimes rating information. There's a pagination section at the bottom, indicating this is the second page. The page also includes a search bar, category menu, and various account-related links.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: To sort products by price and potentially find the lowest priced item more easily
- action: click [5429]

- reason: To return to the first page of products and gather all price information
- action: click [7577]

- reason: To add the lowest priced item visible on this page to the cart (Amosfun 100pcs Cupcake Toppers at $7.39)
- action: click [8293]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
5429, 7577, 8293, 7594, 6753

RAG LOG:
{'id': ['instructions_435_obs1_obs3'], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nLet me carefully analyze the given information and think through the trajectory of actions and their purpose:\n\nHmm, this seems to be a snapshot of an e-commerce website called "One Stop Market". The user, Emma Lopez, is logged in and browsing product listings.\n\nThe instruction given is to "Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart". This suggests the user wants to find the cheapest item and add it to their cart.\n\nLooking at the product listings, I see several items with prices:\n\n1. Cake topper balls - $9.49\n2. Cupcake toppers - $7.39\n3. Collagen creamer - $34.99\n4. Campbell\'s soup - $19.99\n5. Mesquite seasoning - $7.95\n6. Angostura bitters - $51.47\n7. Apple Danish - $19.12\n8. Curry paste - $34.05\n9. Coconut powder - $10.99\n10. Pancake mix - $37.91\n\nThe lowest priced item appears to be the cupcake toppers at $7.39. However, we need to be careful here - the instruction mentions "lowest per unit price", and we don\'t have unit information for most items. For example, the pancake mix specifies it\'s a 10 lb package, which could potentially make it the cheapest per unit despite its higher total price.\n\nGiven the limited information, the safest assumption is probably that the cupcake toppers at $7.39 are the cheapest per unit, unless we had more details on quantities for the other items.\n\nThe trajectory would likely involve:\n1. Scanning through the product listings\n2. Comparing prices (and ideally units, if available)\n3. Identifying the cheapest item (likely the cupcake toppers)\n4. Clicking the "Add to Cart" button for that item\n\nThe higher-level purpose seems to be finding the best value (cheapest per unit) item and adding it to the cart, possibly as part of a budget-conscious shopping strategy.\n```\n\nBased on the analysis, here\'s a summary of the trajectory and its purpose:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. Browse through the product listings on the One Stop Market website\n2. Compare prices of various items\n3. Identify the product with the lowest price (likely the cupcake toppers at $7.39)\n4. Click the "Add to Cart" button for the chosen item\n\nHigher-level purpose:\nThe goal of these actions is to find the most economical product (lowest price per unit) from the available options and add it to the shopping cart. This reflects a cost-conscious approach to online shopping, aiming to maximize value for money spent.', 'external knowledge': '[{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins on a webpage displaying cell phones and accessories. The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website. We give you the right website, please just explore. This task must 100% can be completed without requesting external information or human assistance. Required information should be obtained through your own actions. Keep exploring different approaches until you succeed - never give up or wait for human input.

In each example, first come observation and objective, then come the action and reason, then come next observation, and so on. But we are not sure wether these example is good or bad, learn from it and you need to make your own action):[[{"External Knowledge0": "\nSummarized Instructions:\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\nThe trajectory begins with a search results page displaying various lingerie items, including the target product \"DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit\". The user then clicks the \"Add to Wish List\" button for this specific item. The next observation shows the user's Wish List page, which now includes the newly added item along with two other previously added items.

```thinking
Okay, let's analyze the current situation:

1. The objective was to add "DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit" to the wish list.

2. The current observation shows we're on the "My Wish List" page. This suggests that our previous action of clicking the "Add to Wish List" button was successful.

3. There's an alert message at the top of the page that confirms our target item has been added to the wish list. The message reads: "DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit has been added to your Wish List."

4. Scrolling through the wish list items, I can see the exact item we wanted to add:

This confirms that our objective has been successfully completed. The item is now in the wish list, which was our goal.

Given that we've accomplished our task, the appropriate action now would be to stop and report our success.

RAG LOG:
{'id': ['instructions_468_obs1_obs3'], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nOkay, let\'s analyze this interaction and trajectory:\n\nFirst, I need to rephrase the human\'s instruction:\nThe user wants to add a specific lingerie item (DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit) to their wish list.\n\nNow, looking at the observations:\nHmm, interestingly, there\'s an alert message at the top saying this exact item has already been added to the wish list. This suggests the action was already completed before we see this snapshot of the page.\n\nThe page appears to be the user\'s wish list, showing various items they\'ve saved. I see multiple products listed with options to edit, remove, or add to cart.\n\nScrolling through the items, I notice near the bottom:\n"DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit"\nThis matches exactly with the item the user wanted to add. It\'s listed with a price of $11.09 and options to add to cart or remove.\n\nSo, it seems the significant action - adding the item to the wish list - has already occurred. The trajectory we\'re seeing is actually the aftermath of that action.\n\nAs for the higher-level purpose, it appears the user is curating a list of desired items, likely for future purchase. The wish list functionality allows them to save and organize products they\'re interested in without immediately committing to buy.\n\nThis fits into a broader e-commerce strategy of allowing users to bookmark items, which can increase engagement and potentially lead to more sales down the line.\n```\n\nBased on the analysis of the interaction and observations, here\'s a summary:\n\nSignificant steps/actions:\n1. The user intended to add a specific lingerie item to their wish list.\n2. The item was successfully added to the wish list (as evidenced by the alert message).\n3. The page now displays the user\'s wish list, including the newly added item.\n\nHigher-level abstraction of the purpose/goal:\nThe overall purpose of this trajectory appears to be managing and curating a personalized list of desired products. This wish list functionality allows users to save items they\'re interested in for future consideration or purchase, enhancing their shopping experience and engagement with the e-commerce platform.', 'external knowledge': '[{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins with a search results page displaying various lingerie items, including the target product \\"DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit\\". The user then clicks the \\"Add to Wish List\\" button for this specific item. The next observation shows the user\'s Wish List page, which now includes the newly added item along with two other previously added items. An alert message confirms that the desired product has been successfully added to the Wish List. The user then decides to stop the action, as the objective of adding the specific lingerie item to the Wish List has been accomplished. The final observation reaffirms that the item is indeed present in the Wish List, completing the intended task.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to add a specific lingerie item to the user\'s Wish List on an online shopping platform. The task involves searching for the product \\"DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit\\" on the website, locating it in the search results, and then adding it to the user\'s Wish List. The trajectory demonstrates the process of navigating through the search results, identifying the correct product, clicking the \\"Add to Wish List\\" button, and confirming that the item has been successfully added to the Wish List. The task is completed when the user verifies that the desired product is now listed among the items in their Wish List, alongside other previously added items.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. The instruction and trajectory are aligned, as the trajectory successfully accomplishes the goal of adding the specific lingerie item to the Wish List.\\n2. The trajectory is coherent, with each action logically following the previous observation.\\n3. The trajectory is natural, mimicking real-world interactions a user would perform when adding an item to their Wish List on an online shopping platform.\\n4. The trajectory is reasonable, using a straightforward and efficient method to accomplish the task without unnecessary complications or redundant actions.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task.

It summarizes a trajectory of steps that match our current instruction - searching for the specific lingerie item, finding it in search results, adding it to the wish list, and confirming its addition. The evaluation at the end confirms that the trajectory successfully accomplishes the goal of adding the specific lingerie item to the Wish List.\n\nBased on this analysis, only External Knowledge2 is useful for predicting the next action.

- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let me carefully think through the current situation and our objective...

We're trying to find the product with the lowest per unit price across all open tabs and add it to the cart. We've navigated through two pages of products on the One Stop Market site, but there are a few key issues:

1. We haven't actually checked any other open tabs yet. The objective mentions "from my open tabs", so we need to consider other tabs too.

2. We don't have complete information on per unit prices. The prices shown are total prices, not per unit prices. We'd need more details on quantities or package sizes to calculate the per unit prices accurately.

3. We haven't systematically recorded or compared the prices we've seen so far.

Let's assess our progress and the proposed actions:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[0,1] [Navigated through two pages of products] [Milestone of finding lowest per unit price not achieved]
		We've only looked at products on one website, haven't checked other tabs, and lack per unit price information.

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Moderate value, as it allows us to review the first page again] [Low risk] [Best case: We might notice some important details we missed] [Worst case: We waste time re-reviewing information we've already seen]
- action [1]: [Low value, high risk] [Adding this item to cart is premature] [Best case: By chance, this happens to be the lowest per unit price item] [Worst case: We add an item that's not actually the lowest per unit price, failing our objective]

Neither of these actions directly advances us towards our goal. We need to:
1. Check other open tabs
2. Gather more detailed information on package sizes or quantities to calculate per unit prices
3. Systematically compare prices across all products and tabs

Given the current options, returning to the first page (action [0]) is slightly better as it at least allows us to review all products on this site. But it's not ideal.

ACTION SELECTION:
0

This action is chosen reluctantly, as neither option truly advances our goal. After this, we should look for ways to switch to other open tabs or gather more detailed product information.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity

   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task. Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations. Should focus on helpful not just releted. If any External knowledges are useful, identify which ones have value and explain why they are useful.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's take a moment to process what we're seeing here. We've just landed on the "My Wish List" page after our previous action of adding the HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set to the wish list. This is exactly where we want to be to confirm our task completion.

First thing that catches my eye is the alert message at the top of the page:
"HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits has been added to your Wish List."

This is a great sign! It's direct confirmation that our previous action was successful. The item we wanted to add is now in the wish list.

Let's scan through the rest of the page to double-check. Ah, there it is! I can see the item listed:
"link [10836] 'HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits'"

This is further confirmation that the item has indeed been added to the wish list.

Given this information, I think we can confidently say that we've completed our objective. The HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set has been successfully added to the wish list.

Now, the question is: what's the best way to wrap this up? We don't need to perform any further actions on the website. The task is complete, so the most appropriate next step would be to use the 'stop' action to end the interaction and report our success.

I'll formulate a concise response that clearly states the task completion without any unnecessary elaboration.

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze this interaction trajectory and summarize the key steps and overall purpose...\n\nFirst, I notice the user gave an instruction to add a specific product to their wish list - a Hawaiian beach outfit set for men. \n\nLooking at the observations, I see we\'re on a "My Wish List" page that already contains 14 items. There\'s an alert message at the top stating "HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits has been added to your Wish List."\n\nThis indicates the main action - adding the requested item to the wish list - has already been completed successfully. The alert is confirming this action to the user.\n\nScanning through the rest of the page contents, I see:\n- A list of items already on the wish list, with options to edit, remove, or add to cart\n- Pagination showing this is page 1 of the wish list\n- Account management links and recently ordered items\n- A section at the bottom showing the newly added Hawaiian outfit set\n\nSo in terms of significant steps:\n1. User requested to add a specific item to wish list\n2. System added the item successfully \n3. System displayed a confirmation message\n4. The new item appears at the bottom of the current wish list page\n\nAs for the higher-level purpose, this trajectory seems to be about allowing the user to save an item of interest (the Hawaiian outfit) for potential future purchase by adding it to their wish list. The wish list serves as a place to collect and organize desired items without immediately buying them.\n\nThe overall goal appears to be facilitating the user\'s shopping experience by providing a way to bookmark products they\'re interested in, separate from the immediate purchase flow of the shopping cart.\n```\n\nBased on my analysis, here\'s a summary of the trajectory:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. User requested to add a Hawaiian beach outfit set to their wish list\n2. System successfully added the item to the wish list\n3. A confirmation message was displayed to the user\n4. The newly added item appeared at the bottom of the current wish list page\n\nHigher-level purpose:\nThe overall goal of this trajectory was to allow the user to save an item of interest (the Hawaiian outfit set) for potential future purchase by adding it to their wish list. This action facilitates the user\'s shopping experience by providing a way to bookmark and organize desired products separately from the immediate purchase flow, enhancing the user\'s ability to track items they\'re interested in over time.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits to my wish list\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'My Wish List\'\n\tlink [9345] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [9341] \'My Wish List 14 items\'\n\tlink [9347] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [9244] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [9253] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [9354] \'My Cart 10 10items\'\n\tcombobox [9840] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [10849] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [9843] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [8687]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[9173] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [9169] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [9165] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [9161] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [9157] \'Office Products\'; [9153] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [9149] \'Health & Household\'; [9145] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [9141] \'Electronics\'; [9137] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [9133] \'Video Games\'; [9129] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tmain\n\t\talert [live: assertive] [atomic: True] [relevant: additions text]\n\t\t\ttext \'HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits has been added to your Wish List.

The system message will tell it what it can do, instruction is our final goal, interaction history is some finished steps, observation is what we see now, and based on these thing we want gpt model to predict next action to achieve our goal. \n                Here is some action choice and meaning:\n                click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task. Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

The observation shows that the Sceptre E195BD-SRR 19-Inch 720P LED TV, True Black (2017) has been successfully added to the user's wish list. This is evident from the alert message displayed at the top of the page. The wish list contains 11 items in total, with the newly added TV being one of them. The page displays various other items in the wish list, including laundry detergent, clothing items, and personal care products. Each item in the list has options to add comments, adjust quantity, add to cart, edit, or remove the item. The user interface also provides navigation options for account management, shopping categories, and pagination for the wish list items. After observing this, the action taken is to stop, as the objective of adding a product to the wish list has already been accomplished.\n\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this trajectory was to add a specific product, namely the Sceptre E195BD-SRR 19-Inch 720P LED TV, True Black (2017), to the user's wish list on an online shopping platform. The task began with the user already on the \"My Wish List\" page, where they could view their current list of saved items. The objective was successfully completed before any additional actions were needed, as evidenced by the alert message confirming the addition of the TV to the wish list. The trajectory demonstrates the ease of use of the website's wish list feature, allowing users to save items for future consideration or purchase. It also showcases the website's ability to provide immediate feedback to users about their actions, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

This becomes an issue when you have a game you want to play with mouse and keyboard and the game keeps detecting the controller and changing your layout.Also it is just two stereo speakers which sound weak and muffled. Volume was lower than expected. Chances are if you are a pc gamer you already have a legit headset.I got these so I could talk to people in the room and still play my game but totally not worth it. I do not recommend for PC.

Even those can get annoying after awhile. When I saw this product I knew it would be for me. You charge it with a USB and plug in the headphone jack cable to your compatible controller (PS4,PS5,Xbox One,Xbox series). The volume button is well made. It isn\'t a slider, more like a light switch that if you keep tapping up or down the volume will change.I have a 7.1 surround sound setup and if you don\'t turn up the volume loud it is hard to hear all speakers. With this, the sound is crisp and clear and is engulfing. There are two speakers both under the ear. It is lightweight as well.Obviously if you want privacy with your sound this is not for you. But if you want to have surround sound audio without spending a lot this is definitely worth it. Looking forward to trying all different games with it.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Thomas Demarco\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Absolutely love it!\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \'| Rating 100 |\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \\\\\\"My husband and I sit side by side to game and he likes his volume up, so normally I play without my volume on at all but that becomes impossible when we play games that require you to hear. In the past I would just increase my volume but I often would catch myself looking at his screen instead of paying attention to my own. I also get headaches and wearing headphones only allows me to game for short periods of time if I wear headphones. This is a lifesaver/gamechanger for me!

I wear a headset over ear for 40 hours a week at work, no gaming. It\'s super uncomfortable. I get red and swollen ears by the end of day. I was hopeful this would be a comfortable solution for me, and I would\'t mind using it gaming even. I was wrong. I didn\'t like it, the sound is just like two tiny bluetooth speakers on your shoulder. Even worse, they are making the same sound, no differences. Even worse still, one is faster than the other at sound by a second. So you\'re hearing a garbled echo. I hope they make a second generation that works better, as I do want a comfortable headphone solution, it\'s just being comfortable is where this ends. Will be returning.In summary:Good:-It\'s comfortable.-It looks nice.-Controls are in an easy to use location, and are very easy to understand and intuitive to use without removing the headset..Bad-Speakers are tiny sounding, even on the loudest setting.-Speakers are not surround sound. They each play the same thing on left and right.-Speakers have a delay on one side. So one side is about a second or half a second behind, so it comes out as a garbled mess to me. Mind you, this isn\'t bluetooth. This is hard wired with a 3.5mm cable. So there should be no delay.-This is not bluetooth, and is battery operated. The instructions state to not charge it while you use it, and the battery life isn\'t great. I couldn\'t make it through a 4 hour gaming session, let alone a 10 hour work day.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'TheMovieHero\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'I wish this was better...\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \'| Rating 40 |\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'I really wanted this headset to be good.. unfortunately Hori did not. Personally, I find the Pulse 3D headset uncomfortable during long game sessions, so I was hoping that this could be a suitable alternative.This is an average headset - at best. It is comfortable to wear and the controls are easy to reach. Also, I found spoken dialog (game characters) sounds OK. That is where the pros end for me.This is in no way a 3D headset - this is just a speaker on your shoulders. The audio quality is hollow - nothing is emphasized. Everything sounds flat and ultimately, it distracts from the gameplay experience. I did not try the mic function, so I am not sure about its quality.If this headset was 30 it may be acceptable - maybe. But for Hori to call this a 3D headset for PS5 at a 100 price point, no, it is not worth it in my view. I would not recommend this product; the audio quality is simply too flat with no bass and no surround.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'GF\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlist \'Page\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \\\\\\"You\'re currently reading page\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [10432] \'Page 2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [9679] \'Page Next\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [9684] \\\\\\"You\'re reviewing: HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset - Wearable Speaker with Voice Chat Designed for Xbox Series XS - Xbox Series X\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [9685] \'Your Rating\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \\\\\\"| Rating 1 star 1 star Rating 2 stars 2 stars Rating 3 stars 3 stars Rating 4 stars 4 stars Rating 5 stars 5 stars\\\\\\\\tradio [10468] \'Rating 1 star\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10469] \'Rating 2 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10470] \'Rating 3 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10471] \'Rating 4 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10472] \'Rating 5 stars\' [checked: false] |\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10257] \'Nickname\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10261] \'Summary\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10265] \'Review\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbutton [10195] \'Submit Review\'\\\\n\\\\tcontentinfo\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [8241] \'Sign Up for Our Newsletter:\' [required: False]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tbutton [8164] \'Subscribe\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10071] \'Privacy and Cookie Policy\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10072] \'Search Terms\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10073] \'Advanced Search\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10074] \'Orders and Returns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10075] \'Contact Us\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Copyright 2013-present Magento, Inc.

This becomes an issue when you have a game you want to play with mouse and keyboard and the game keeps detecting the controller and changing your layout.Also it is just two stereo speakers which sound weak and muffled. Volume was lower than expected. Chances are if you are a pc gamer you already have a legit headset.I got these so I could talk to people in the room and still play my game but totally not worth it.

Even those can get annoying after awhile. When I saw this product I knew it would be for me. You charge it with a USB and plug in the headphone jack cable to your compatible controller (PS4,PS5,Xbox One,Xbox series). The volume button is well made. It isn\'t a slider, more like a light switch that if you keep tapping up or down the volume will change.I have a 7.1 surround sound setup and if you don\'t turn up the volume loud it is hard to hear all speakers. With this, the sound is crisp and clear and is engulfing. There are two speakers both under the ear. It is lightweight as well.Obviously if you want privacy with your sound this is not for you. But if you want to have surround sound audio without spending a lot this is definitely worth it. Looking forward to trying all different games with it.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Thomas Demarco\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Absolutely love it!\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \'| Rating 100 |\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \\\\\\"My husband and I sit side by side to game and he likes his volume up, so normally I play without my volume on at all but that becomes impossible when we play games that require you to hear.

I wear a headset over ear for 40 hours a week at work, no gaming. It\'s super uncomfortable. I get red and swollen ears by the end of day. I was hopeful this would be a comfortable solution for me, and I would\'t mind using it gaming even. I was wrong. I didn\'t like it, the sound is just like two tiny bluetooth speakers on your shoulder. Even worse, they are making the same sound, no differences. Even worse still, one is faster than the other at sound by a second. So you\'re hearing a garbled echo. I hope they make a second generation that works better, as I do want a comfortable headphone solution, it\'s just being comfortable is where this ends. Will be returning.In summary:Good:-It\'s comfortable.-It looks nice.-Controls are in an easy to use location, and are very easy to understand and intuitive to use without removing the headset..Bad-Speakers are tiny sounding, even on the loudest setting.-Speakers are not surround sound. They each play the same thing on left and right.-Speakers have a delay on one side. So one side is about a second or half a second behind, so it comes out as a garbled mess to me. Mind you, this isn\'t bluetooth. This is hard wired with a 3.5mm cable. So there should be no delay.-This is not bluetooth, and is battery operated. The instructions state to not charge it while you use it, and the battery life isn\'t great. I couldn\'t make it through a 4 hour gaming session, let alone a 10 hour work day.\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'TheMovieHero\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'I wish this was better...\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \'| Rating 40 |\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'I really wanted this headset to be good.. unfortunately Hori did not. Personally, I find the Pulse 3D headset uncomfortable during long game sessions, so I was hoping that this could be a suitable alternative.This is an average headset - at best. It is comfortable to wear and the controls are easy to reach. Also, I found spoken dialog (game characters) sounds OK. That is where the pros end for me.This is in no way a 3D headset - this is just a speaker on your shoulders. The audio quality is hollow - nothing is emphasized. Everything sounds flat and ultimately, it distracts from the gameplay experience. I did not try the mic function, so I am not sure about its quality.If this headset was 30 it may be acceptable - maybe. But for Hori to call this a 3D headset for PS5 at a 100 price point, no, it is not worth it in my view. I would not recommend this product; the audio quality is simply too flat with no bass and no surround.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'GF\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlist \'Page\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \\\\\\"You\'re currently reading page\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [10432] \'Page 2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [9679] \'Page Next\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [9684] \\\\\\"You\'re reviewing: HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset - Wearable Speaker with Voice Chat Designed for Xbox Series XS - Xbox Series X\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [9685] \'Your Rating\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \\\\\\"| Rating 1 star 1 star Rating 2 stars 2 stars Rating 3 stars 3 stars Rating 4 stars 4 stars Rating 5 stars 5 stars\\\\\\\\tradio [10468] \'Rating 1 star\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10469] \'Rating 2 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10470] \'Rating 3 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10471] \'Rating 4 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10472] \'Rating 5 stars\' [checked: false] |\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10257] \'Nickname\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10261] \'Summary\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10265] \'Review\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbutton [10195] \'Submit Review\'\\\\n\\\\tcontentinfo\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [8241] \'Sign Up for Our Newsletter:\' [required: False]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tbutton [8164] \'Subscribe\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10071] \'Privacy and Cookie Policy\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10072] \'Search Terms\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10073] \'Advanced Search\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10074] \'Orders and Returns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10075] \'Contact Us\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Copyright 2013-present Magento, Inc.

I would not recommend this product; the audio quality is simply too flat with no bass and no surround.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'GF\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlist \'Page\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \\\\\\"You\'re currently reading page\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [10432] \'Page 2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [9679] \'Page Next\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [9684] \\\\\\"You\'re reviewing: HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset - Wearable Speaker with Voice Chat Designed for Xbox Series XS - Xbox Series X\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [9685] \'Your Rating\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \\\\\\"| Rating 1 star 1 star Rating 2 stars 2 stars Rating 3 stars 3 stars Rating 4 stars 4 stars Rating 5 stars 5 stars\\\\\\\\tradio [10468] \'Rating 1 star\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10469] \'Rating 2 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10470] \'Rating 3 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10471] \'Rating 4 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [10472] \'Rating 5 stars\' [checked: false] |\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10257] \'Nickname\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10261] \'Summary\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [10265] \'Review\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbutton [10195] \'Submit Review\'\\\\n\\\\tcontentinfo\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [8241] \'Sign Up for Our Newsletter:\' [required: False]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tbutton [8164] \'Subscribe\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10071] \'Privacy and Cookie Policy\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10072] \'Search Terms\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10073] \'Advanced Search\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10074] \'Orders and Returns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [10075] \'Contact Us\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Copyright 2013-present Magento, Inc.

The observation shows that the Sceptre E195BD-SRR 19-Inch 720P LED TV, True Black (2017) has been successfully added to the user\'s wish list. This is evident from the alert message displayed at the top of the page. The wish list contains 11 items in total, with the newly added TV being one of them. The page displays various other items in the wish list, including laundry detergent, clothing items, and personal care products. Each item in the list has options to add comments, adjust quantity, add to cart, edit, or remove the item. The user interface also provides navigation options for account management, shopping categories, and pagination for the wish list items.

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [9742]
|	reason for action [0]:
We need to increase the quantity of the item from 1 to 2 as per the objective.

|	action [1]:
click [9866]
|	reason for action [1]:
After increasing the quantity, we need to save the changes.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's carefully analyze the current situation and our progress towards the objective.

First, I need to assess our plan progress:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[0, 1] We successfully searched for and found the "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts" item.
	[1] We added the item to the wish list, as evidenced by the alert message "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts has been added to your Wish List."
	[2] We attempted to increase the quantity from 1 to 2, but it seems the action wasn't successful. The current observation still shows the quantity as 1 for this item.

So we've made good progress, but we haven't fully achieved our objective yet. We still need to increase the quantity to 2 and ensure the changes are saved.

Now, let's assess the proposed actions:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: click [9742]
	Value: High. This action directly addresses our need to increase the quantity from 1 to 2.
	Risk: Low. Clicking a spinbutton is a standard action with little risk.
	Best case: The quantity increases to 2, bringing us closer to our objective.
	Worst case: The quantity doesn't change, but we can try again or look for alternative methods.

- action [1]: click [9866]
	Value: Medium. Updating the wish list is necessary, but we need to increase the quantity first.
	Risk: Low to Medium. While updating is generally safe, doing so before changing the quantity might lock in the current state.
	Best case: Our changes (if any) are saved.
	Worst case: We might save the wish list before making the necessary changes, requiring us to edit it again.

Given this assessment, I believe the best course of action is to first increase the quantity and then update the wish list. Therefore, I'll choose action [0].

ACTION SELECTION:
0
```

I select action 0: click [9742]. This action will attempt to increase the quantity of the Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots from 1 to 2, which is necessary to fulfill our objective. After this, we'll need to update the wish list to save the changes.

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.

1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's think through this task step-by-step:

1. Rephrasing the objective: I need to find the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs and add it to the shopping cart.

2. Current situation: I'm on the main page of One Stop Market, which shows 12 out of 24 total products. This is the first page of products.

3. What I need to do:
   a) Gather information on all products, including those on the second page
   b) Calculate the per unit price for each product
   c) Identify the product with the lowest per unit price
   d) Add that product to the cart

4. Current page analysis:
   - There are 12 products listed
   - Each product has a name, price, and sometimes rating information
   - There's a pagination section indicating there's a second page with more products

5. Next steps:
   - I need to note down the information for these 12 products
   - Then I should navigate to the second page to get information on the remaining products
   - After that, I'll need to calculate and compare per unit prices

Let's start by noting down the information for the products on this page:

1. Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit: $19.99 for 34 oz (2 pack of 17 oz each)
2. V8 Energy Drink: $14.47 for 24 cans (8 oz each, total 192 oz)
3. Elmwood Inn Fine Teas: $19.36 for 16 oz
4. Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix: $23.50 for 8 oz
5. So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip Light: $15.62 for 9 oz
6. Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder: $34.00 for 1000g (2 packs of 500g)
7. Q Mixers Premium Ginger Ale: $68.50 for 24 bottles (6.7 fl oz each, total 160.8 fl oz)
8. Stove Top Turkey Stuffing Mix: $8.49 for 24 oz (2 packs of 12 oz)
9. Briess DME - Pilsen Light: $12.99 for 1 lb (16 oz)
10. Tony Chachere's More Spice Creole Seasoning: $7.92 for 14 oz
11. Lobster Cobbler Pot Pie: $411.76 for 8 trays (no weight information)
12. Crunchy Rice Rollers: $11.50 for 4 packs (3.5 oz each, total 14 oz)

Now that I've noted this information, I should proceed to the second page to gather information on the remaining products.

The next logical action is to click on the link to the second page of products.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
The interaction history shows that we have already navigated through the home page and both pages of products. We are currently back on the first page of products after viewing all available items.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page displays the first 12 out of 24 total products on the One Stop Market website. Each product listing includes the product name, price, and sometimes rating information. There's a pagination section at the bottom, indicating there's a second page with more products. The page also includes various account-related links, a search bar, and a category menu.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: We need to view the second page of products to gather information on all available items and calculate the lowest per unit price.
- action: click [10678]

- reason: We have already viewed both pages of products and gathered the necessary information. We should now calculate the per unit prices and identify the product with the lowest per unit price.
- action: note [Calculating per unit prices for all products]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
10678, 11386, 11395, 11404, 11413, 11422, 11430, 11439, 11448, 11455, 11464, 11472, 11481

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me analyze this trajectory carefully...\n\nThe observation shows a web page for an online marketplace called "One Stop Market". It appears to be displaying a product catalog or search results page with various food and beverage items.\n\nThe key elements I\'m seeing:\n- A header with account/cart links and search functionality\n- A main content area listing 12 products with details like name, price, rating, and "Add to Cart" buttons\n- Pagination showing this is page 1 of 2 \n- A footer with newsletter signup and policy links\n\nNow, looking at the specific instruction:\n"Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart"\n\nThis suggests the user wants to find the cheapest item (on a per unit basis) and add it to their cart. However, there are some challenges here:\n\n1. We don\'t have information about other "open tabs" - only this single page is shown.\n2. The prices given don\'t include unit information, so we can\'t directly compare per unit prices.\n3. There\'s no clear action taken in the trajectory - it\'s just a static page view.\n\nGiven these limitations, I can\'t identify specific steps or actions that were actually taken. The trajectory seems to simply be viewing this product listing page.\n\nAs for the higher-level purpose, it appears the goal was to browse products and potentially make a purchase decision based on price. The user seems price-sensitive and is looking to optimize their purchase by finding the best value item.\n\nSo in summary:\n- No clear actions were taken yet\n- The goal seems to be product browsing and price comparison\n- The user intends to make a budget-conscious purchase decision\n\nI\'ll craft a response that acknowledges these points while noting the limitations in fully addressing the original instruction.\n```\n\nBased on the observation, it appears the trajectory consists of viewing a product listing page on the "One Stop Market" website. No specific actions were taken yet to add items to the cart or compare prices across tabs.\n\nThe higher-level goal seems to be browsing products and comparing prices in order to make a budget-conscious purchase decision. The user is looking to find the best value item, likely intending to add the lowest per-unit price product to their cart once identified.\n\nHowever, it\'s worth noting that the available information is limited to this single page view, without details on other open tabs or per-unit pricing. This makes it challenging to fully execute the instruction of finding the lowest per-unit priced item across tabs and adding it to the cart.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'One Stop Market\'\n\tlink [10454] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [10450] \'My Wish List 4 items\'\n\tlink [10456] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [10380] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [10389] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [10463] \'My Cart\'\n\tcombobox [10694] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [11502] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [10697] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [9840]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[10308] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [10304] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [10300] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [10296] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [10292] \'Office Products\'; [10288] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [10284] \'Health & Household\'; [10280] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [10276] \'Electronics\'; [10272] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [10268] \'Video Games\'; [10264] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'One Stop Market\'\n\t\ttext \'Product Showcases\'\n\t\tlink [10614] \'Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit Value Pack, 17 oz., Pack of 2, Total 34 oz.\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 20\'\n\t\t\tlink [11380] \'1 Review\'\n\t\ttext \'19.99\'\n\t\tbutton [11386] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10119] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10479] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10618] \'V8 Energy, Healthy Energy Drink, Steady Energy from Black and Green Tea, Pomegranate Blueberry, 8 Ounce Can ,Pack of 24\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 57\'\n\t\t\tlink [11389] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'14.47\'\n\t\tbutton [11395] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10133] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10491] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10622] \'Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, Orange Vanilla Caffeine-free Fruit Infusion, 16-Ounce Pouch\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 95\'\n\t\t\tlink [11398] \'4 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'19.36\'\n\t\tbutton [11404] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10147] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10503] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10626] \'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix Wedding Colorful Sprinkles Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles Ice cream Candy Sprinkles Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles, 8OZ\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 63\'\n\t\t\tlink [11407] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'23.50\'\n\t\tbutton [11413] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10161] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10511] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10632] \'So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip Light, Vegan, Non-GMO Project Verified, 9 oz.

However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

The system message will tell it what it can do, instruction is our final goal, interaction history is some finished steps, observation is what we see now, and based on these thing we want gpt model to predict next action to achieve our goal. \n                Here is some action choice and meaning:\n                click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task.

However, they are not directly relevant to the current task of adding the product with the lowest per unit price from open tabs to the shopping cart.\n\nThe current observation shows we are on a page displaying Cell Phones & Accessories, and we've already added the lowest-priced item from this page to the cart. The next logical step would be to compare this price with items in other open tabs, but the External knowledge doesn't provide information about other tabs or how to navigate between them.\n\nWhile the External knowledge demonstrates a similar process of finding low-priced items and adding them to a cart, it doesn't provide specific information that would help in this particular scenario where we need to compare across multiple tabs.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that none of the provided External knowledge is particularly useful for predicting the next action in this specific context.\n\nUseful External knowledge: []\n\nNo External knowledge is deemed useful in this case as they don't provide relevant information for navigating between tabs or comparing prices across different pages in the current scenario."}

<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are a seasoned web navigator. You now assess the value and risk of serveral web navigation actions based on the objective, the previous interaction history and the web's current state. Then, you select the action with the most value and least risk with which you would earn the maximum objective fulfillment reward in the future.

Adhere to the following output format:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
Review critically why the plans have not been fulfilled or the objective achieved. Justify your assessment with detailed evidence drawn from the objective, observations, and actions taken. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
note [Calculating per unit prices for all products]
|	reason for action [0]:
We have already viewed both pages of products and gathered the necessary information. We should now calculate the per unit prices and identify the product with the lowest per unit price.

|	action [1]:
click [10678]
|	reason for action [1]:
We need to view the second page of products to gather information on all available items and calculate the lowest per unit price.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let me carefully think through this situation...

First, I need to assess our progress on the plan. We've been navigating through the product pages, but we haven't actually started calculating per unit prices or identifying the lowest one yet. Let's break that down:

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
    [0, 1, 2] We've viewed both pages of products, gathering information on all 24 items. However, we haven't started calculating per unit prices or identifying the lowest one. The plan is not yet fulfilled because we haven't performed the crucial step of price comparison.

Now, let's consider our action options:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [High value, as it directly addresses our objective of finding the lowest per unit price. This action will allow us to process the information we've gathered and make a decision.] [Low risk, as we're working with information we already have.] [Best case: We successfully identify the product with the lowest per unit price and can proceed to add it to the cart.] [Worst case: We might make a calculation error, but we can always double-check our work.]

- action [1]: [Low value, as we've already viewed both pages of products and don't need to gather more information.] [Low risk, but unnecessary.] [Best case: We confirm that we haven't missed any products, but this is redundant.] [Worst case: We waste time and potentially confuse ourselves by re-viewing information we already have.]

Analyzing these options, it's clear that action [0] is the most valuable and relevant to our objective. We've already gathered all the necessary information by viewing both pages of products. Now is the time to process that information and calculate the per unit prices.

Action [1] would be redundant at this point. We've already seen all 24 products across both pages, so revisiting the second page wouldn't provide any new information that would help us achieve our goal.

Therefore, the most logical and efficient next step is to proceed with calculating the per unit prices for all products we've seen. This will directly contribute to fulfilling our objective of finding the product with the lowest per unit price.

ACTION SELECTION:
0
```

I select action 0: note [Calculating per unit prices for all products].

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity

6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action to complete our objective.

First, I need to rephrase the human's message to ensure I understand the task correctly. The objective is to add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts to the wish list.

Now, let's look at what we've accomplished so far and what we still need to do:

1. We've successfully added the item to the wish list. I can see it listed in the "My Wish List" section.
2. The quantity is currently set to 1, but we need to increase it to 2.
3. There's an "Update Wish List" button that we'll need to click after changing the quantity.

Looking at the current observation, I see that the item we're interested in is indeed in the wish list:

link [11011] '2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts'

And right below it, there's a spinbutton for quantity:

spinbutton [10654] 'Qty' [required: False] [valuemin: 0] [valuemax: 0] [valuetext: ]
	text '1'

This spinbutton has an ID of 10654, and it's currently set to 1. We need to increase this to 2.

After changing the quantity, we'll need to update the wish list. I see the "Update Wish List" button:

button [10778] 'Update Wish List'

So, our plan of action should be:
1. Click the spinbutton to increase the quantity from 1 to 2
2. Click the "Update Wish List" button to save the changes

Let's start with clicking the spinbutton to increase the quantity.

Hmm, I'm noticing that the spinbutton doesn't have a clear way to increment the value. In previous interactions, we've been able to click on the spinbutton to increase the value. Let's try that approach here as well.

If this doesn't work, we might need to look for alternative ways to change the quantity, such as typing the new value directly or looking for separate increment/decrement buttons.

I'll propose clicking the spinbutton as our action for this step.

This seems like the most straightforward approach based on our current observation and previous interactions. If it doesn't work as expected, we can adjust our strategy in the next step.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
The user has successfully added the "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts" to their wish list. The current quantity is set to 1, but the objective requires increasing it to 2.

Personally, I find the Pulse 3D headset uncomfortable during long game sessions, so I was hoping that this could be a suitable alternative.This is an average headset - at best. It is comfortable to wear and the controls are easy to reach. Also, I found spoken dialog (game characters) sounds OK. That is where the pros end for me.This is in no way a 3D headset - this is just a speaker on your shoulders. The audio quality is hollow - nothing is emphasized. Everything sounds flat and ultimately, it distracts from the gameplay experience. I did not try the mic function, so I am not sure about its quality.If this headset was 30 it may be acceptable - maybe. But for Hori to call this a 3D headset for PS5 at a 100 price point, no, it is not worth it in my view. I would not recommend this product; the audio quality is simply too flat with no bass and no surround.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'GF\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlist \'Page\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [10980] \'Page Previous\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [11431] \'Page 1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \\\\\\"You\'re currently reading page\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [10985] \\\\\\"You\'re reviewing: HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset - Wearable Speaker with Voice Chat Designed for Xbox Series XS - Xbox Series X\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [10986] \'Your Rating\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \\\\\\"| Rating 1 star 1 star Rating 2 stars 2 stars Rating 3 stars 3 stars Rating 4 stars 4 stars Rating 5 stars 5 stars\\\\\\\\tradio [11452] \'Rating 1 star\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11453] \'Rating 2 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11454] \'Rating 3 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11455] \'Rating 4 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11456] \'Rating 5 stars\' [checked: false] |\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [11377] \'Nickname\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [11381] \'Summary\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [11385] \'Review\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbutton [11315] \'Submit Review\'\\\\n\\\\tcontentinfo\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [8241] \'Sign Up for Our Newsletter:\' [required: False]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tbutton [8164] \'Subscribe\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11191] \'Privacy and Cookie Policy\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11192] \'Search Terms\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11193] \'Advanced Search\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11194] \'Orders and Returns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11195] \'Contact Us\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Copyright 2013-present Magento, Inc.

Italian reviews are on about, but they seem to be trolling this product. I tried it out and the sound quality is crisp, loud, and very good. It\'s not perfect by any means, as when audio becomes silent you do listen to some subtle hiss coming from it. But overall, I\'m happy with them.

Personally, I find the Pulse 3D headset uncomfortable during long game sessions, so I was hoping that this could be a suitable alternative.This is an average headset - at best. It is comfortable to wear and the controls are easy to reach. Also, I found spoken dialog (game characters) sounds OK. That is where the pros end for me.This is in no way a 3D headset - this is just a speaker on your shoulders. The audio quality is hollow - nothing is emphasized. Everything sounds flat and ultimately, it distracts from the gameplay experience. I did not try the mic function, so I am not sure about its quality.If this headset was 30 it may be acceptable - maybe. But for Hori to call this a 3D headset for PS5 at a 100 price point, no, it is not worth it in my view. I would not recommend this product; the audio quality is simply too flat with no bass and no surround.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'GF\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttime \'4/19/23\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlist \'Page\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [10980] \'Page Previous\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tlink [11431] \'Page 1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \\\\\\"You\'re currently reading page\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttext \'2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [10985] \\\\\\"You\'re reviewing: HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset - Wearable Speaker with Voice Chat Designed for Xbox Series XS - Xbox Series X\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tgroup [10986] \'Your Rating\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTable\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLayoutTableRow \\\\\\"| Rating 1 star 1 star Rating 2 stars 2 stars Rating 3 stars 3 stars Rating 4 stars 4 stars Rating 5 stars 5 stars\\\\\\\\tradio [11452] \'Rating 1 star\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11453] \'Rating 2 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11454] \'Rating 3 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11455] \'Rating 4 stars\' [checked: false]\\\\\\\\tradio [11456] \'Rating 5 stars\' [checked: false] |\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [11377] \'Nickname\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [11381] \'Summary\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [11385] \'Review\' [required: True]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbutton [11315] \'Submit Review\'\\\\n\\\\tcontentinfo\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttextbox [8241] \'Sign Up for Our Newsletter:\' [required: False]\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tbutton [8164] \'Subscribe\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11191] \'Privacy and Cookie Policy\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11192] \'Search Terms\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11193] \'Advanced Search\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11194] \'Orders and Returns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tlink [11195] \'Contact Us\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\ttext \'Copyright 2013-present Magento, Inc.

The page displays three items already in the wish list, including the target item \\"DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit\\". An alert message is visible, confirming that this item has been successfully added to the wish list. The user observes the details of all three items in the wish list, including their images, prices, and options to add comments or adjust quantities. The trajectory ends with two consecutive \\"stop\\" actions, both indicating that the objective has been achieved as the target item is already present in the wish list. No further actions are taken, as the goal was already accomplished before the trajectory began.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory was to verify the successful addition of a specific lingerie item to the user\'s wish list on an online shopping platform. The user needed to confirm that the item \\"DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit\\" was present in their wish list. Upon accessing the \\"My Wish List\\" page, the user was to check for an alert message confirming the item\'s addition and then locate the item within the list of wish list products. Once the presence of the item was verified, the task was considered complete. This trajectory demonstrates the process of checking and confirming a recent addition to a wish list without requiring any further actions, as the desired outcome had already been achieved prior to the start of the trajectory.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\nThe instruction and trajectory are aligned, as the trajectory confirms the presence of the specified item in the wish list, which was the goal of the instruction. The trajectory is coherent, with both observations showing the same state and the actions logically concluding that the objective has been met. The trajectory is natural, mimicking a real-world scenario where a user might check their wish list after adding an item. The trajectory is reasonable, as it simply verifies the presence of the item without unnecessary complications. Therefore, this pair meets all the criteria for a good instruction-trajectory pair.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit to my wish list\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-shopping.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): My Wish List\\\\n\\\\n[5609] RootWebArea \'My Wish List\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[5812] link \'My Account\'\\\\n\\\\t[5809] link \'My Wish List 3 items\'\\\\n\\\\t[5814] link \'Sign Out\'\\\\n\\\\t[7961] StaticText \'Welcome to One Stop Market\'\\\\n\\\\t[5640] link \'Skip to Content\'\\\\n\\\\t[5649] link \'store logo\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5820] img \'one_stop_market_logo\'\\\\n\\\\t[5821] link \'\\\\\\\\ue611 My Cart\'\\\\n\\\\t[7313] StaticText \'Search\'\\\\n\\\\t[6044] combobox \'\\\\\\\\ue615 Search\' autocomplete: both hasPopup: listbox required: False expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t[7316] link \'Advanced Search\'\\\\n\\\\t[6047] button \'Search\' disabled: True\\\\n\\\\t[7845] tablist \'\' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[7847] tabpanel \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7381] menu \'\' orientation: vertical\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7542] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Beauty & Personal Care\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7607] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Sports & Outdoors\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7617] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7631] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Home & Kitchen\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7668] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Office Products\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7676] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Tools & Home Improvement\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7681] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Health & Household\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7687] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Patio, Lawn & Garden\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7692] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Electronics\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7753] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Cell Phones & Accessories\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7768] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Video Games\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7781] menuitem \'\\\\\\\\ue622 Grocery & Gourmet Food\' hasPopup: menu\\\\n\\\\t[5619] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5672] alert \'\' live: assertive atomic: True relevant: additions text\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[7973] StaticText \'DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit has been added to your Wish List.

In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123].

E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS.

--------------------------------JUDGE--------------------------------
INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
type [10654] [2] [0]
|	reason for action [0]:
If clicking doesn't work, we might need to type the desired quantity directly into the spinbutton.

|	action [1]:
click [10654]
|	reason for action [1]:
We need to increase the quantity of the item from 1 to 2 as per the objective. Clicking the spinbutton has worked in previous interactions to increment the value.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's carefully assess the current situation and our progress towards the objective.

First, I need to review why we haven't fully achieved our goal yet. The objective is to add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts to the wish list. We've made significant progress, but we're not quite there yet.

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[0, 1] [Successfully searched for and found the item] [Milestone achieved]
	[1] [Successfully added the item to the wish list] [Milestone achieved]
	[2, 3] [Attempted to increase quantity to 2, but unsuccessful] [Milestone not achieved yet]

We've successfully found the item and added it to the wish list. However, we haven't managed to increase the quantity to 2 yet. In the previous steps, we tried clicking the spinbutton twice, but it seems that didn't work as expected. The current observation still shows the quantity as 1.

Now, let's assess our action choices:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: type [10654] [2] [0]
[Value: High. This action directly addresses our remaining goal of setting the quantity to 2. If successful, it will complete our objective.]
[Risk: Low. Typing a value directly into a spinbutton is a common and usually safe operation.]
[Best case: The quantity is successfully set to 2, completing our objective.]
[Worst case: The input is not accepted, leaving us at the same point we are now.]

- action [1]: click [10654]
[Value: Moderate. This action attempts to increment the quantity, which is what we need. However, it has failed in previous attempts.]
[Risk: Low. Clicking a spinbutton is a safe operation, but it might not produce the desired result based on our previous attempts.]
[Best case: The quantity is incremented to 2, completing our objective.]
[Worst case: The quantity remains at 1, leaving us where we started.]

Considering these assessments, I believe the best course of action is to try typing the desired quantity directly. This approach has a higher chance of success given that clicking hasn't worked in our previous attempts.

ACTION SELECTION:
0

This action gives us the best chance of achieving our objective by directly inputting the desired quantity. If this doesn't work, we may need to explore other options or seek assistance.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's analyze this situation and figure out the best approach to find the product with the lowest per unit price.

First, I need to rephrase what we're trying to do here. We're looking for the product that gives us the most value for our money across all the open tabs. This means we need to calculate the price per unit for each product and compare them.

Looking at the current observation, we're on the main page of One Stop Market, showing 12 out of 24 total products. This is good because we have access to half of the products right now. 

Let's break down what we know:
1. We're on page 1 of 2
2. Each product listing shows the name, price, and sometimes rating
3. We need to view all products to make a comprehensive comparison
4. We've already seen the second page in a previous step

Now, the tricky part is that we don't have the unit measurements for all products directly visible. We'll need to click into each product to get more details and calculate the per unit price.

I should also keep in mind that the "open tabs" mentioned in the objective likely refer to these product pages we're viewing, not actual browser tabs.

So, what's the best way to approach this?

1. We could go through each product on this page, click into it, note down the price and unit measurement, then move to the next page and repeat.
2. We could note down all the prices and product names from both pages first, then investigate each product in detail.
3. We could start with the products that seem to have the lowest overall price, assuming they might have the lowest per unit price too (though this isn't always true).

I think the most systematic approach would be option 2. This way, we can get an overview of all products first, then dive into the details of each one efficiently.

Let's start by noting down the products and prices on this page.

Hmm... on second thought, I realize we've already viewed both pages in previous steps. The note action in step 3 suggests we're ready to calculate per unit prices. This means we should already have all the necessary information.

In this case, the best action would be to review our notes and calculate the per unit prices based on the information we've gathered. Once we identify the product with the lowest per unit price, we can add it to the cart.

Let's proceed with this plan.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
We have viewed both pages of products and gathered the necessary information. In the previous step, we decided to calculate per unit prices for all products.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page displays 12 out of 24 total products on the One Stop Market website. Each product listing includes the product name, price, and sometimes rating information. There's a pagination section at the bottom, indicating there's a second page with more products. The page also includes a search bar, category menu, and various account-related links.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: [We have already gathered information on all products and need to identify the one with the lowest per unit price.]
- action: [note [Reviewing gathered information to identify the product with the lowest per unit price]]

- reason: [After identifying the product with the lowest per unit price, we need to add it to the cart.]
- action: [click [11386]]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
11386, 11395, 11404, 11413, 11422, 11430, 11439, 11448, 11455, 11464, 11472, 11481, 10678

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze this situation and break down what\'s happening here:\n\nThe user has given an instruction to add the product with the lowest per unit price from their open tabs to the shopping cart. However, the observation provided doesn\'t show multiple open tabs - it seems to be a single product listing page on an e-commerce site called "One Stop Market".\n\nLooking at the page structure, I see:\n- A header with account info, search bar, and navigation menu\n- A main content area with a product showcase\n- 12 different products listed with details like name, rating, price, and "Add to Cart" buttons\n- Pagination showing this is page 1 of 2\n\nThe goal appears to be finding the cheapest item per unit and adding it to the cart. But there\'s a challenge - the prices shown don\'t include unit information, just total price. Without knowing quantities/sizes, it\'s impossible to accurately determine price per unit.\n\nLet\'s see what we can deduce though:\n1. The cheapest total price item is the Stove Top Turkey Stuffing Mix at $8.49\n2. The most expensive is the Lobster Cobbler Pot Pie at $411.76\n\nSome items do have quantity info in the name:\n- V8 Energy drinks: Pack of 24, 8oz cans, $14.47 total\n- Gingerbread House Kit: Pack of 2, 34 oz total, $19.99\n- Q Mixers Ginger Ale: 24 bottles, 6.7 fl oz each, $68.50 total\n\nWithout more info, the V8 Energy drinks seem to have the lowest price per unit that we can calculate ($0.60 per 8oz can).\n\nHowever, this analysis is incomplete as we can\'t compare all items fairly. The user\'s original request can\'t be fully carried out with the given information.\n\nI should explain this limitation to the user and suggest the best course of action based on available data.\n```\n\nBased on the available information, I cannot definitively determine the product with the lowest per unit price, as unit sizes are not provided for all items. However, I can offer some insights and a suggested action:\n\n1. The cheapest item overall is the Stove Top Turkey Stuffing Mix at $8.49.\n2. Among items with clear unit pricing, the V8 Energy drinks appear to have the lowest price per unit at approximately $0.60 per 8oz can.\n\nGiven the limitations of the available data, I would recommend adding the V8 Energy drink pack to the cart, as it\'s the best value we can confirm. However, I should also advise you that this may not be the absolute lowest per unit price item, as we lack complete information for all products.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with adding the V8 Energy drinks to your cart, or would you prefer to review more product details before making a decision?', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'One Stop Market\'\n\tlink [10454] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [10450] \'My Wish List 4 items\'\n\tlink [10456] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [10380] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [10389] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [10463] \'My Cart\'\n\tcombobox [10694] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [11502] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [10697] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [9840]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[10308] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [10304] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [10300] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [10296] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [10292] \'Office Products\'; [10288] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [10284] \'Health & Household\'; [10280] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [10276] \'Electronics\'; [10272] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [10268] \'Video Games\'; [10264] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'One Stop Market\'\n\t\ttext \'Product Showcases\'\n\t\tlink [10614] \'Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit Value Pack, 17 oz., Pack of 2, Total 34 oz.\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 20\'\n\t\t\tlink [11380] \'1 Review\'\n\t\ttext \'19.99\'\n\t\tbutton [11386] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10119] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10479] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10618] \'V8 Energy, Healthy Energy Drink, Steady Energy from Black and Green Tea, Pomegranate Blueberry, 8 Ounce Can ,Pack of 24\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 57\'\n\t\t\tlink [11389] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'14.47\'\n\t\tbutton [11395] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10133] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10491] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10622] \'Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, Orange Vanilla Caffeine-free Fruit Infusion, 16-Ounce Pouch\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 95\'\n\t\t\tlink [11398] \'4 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'19.36\'\n\t\tbutton [11404] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10147] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10503] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10626] \'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix Wedding Colorful Sprinkles Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles Ice cream Candy Sprinkles Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles, 8OZ\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 63\'\n\t\t\tlink [11407] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'23.50\'\n\t\tbutton [11413] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10161] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10511] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10632] \'So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip Light, Vegan, Non-GMO Project Verified, 9 oz.

The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123].

OBJECTIVE:
Add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts to my wish list

STEP:
5

URL:
http://127.0.0.1:7770/wishlist/index/index/wishlist_id/5/

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's carefully analyze the current situation and what we need to do next.

First, I'll rephrase the objective to make sure I understand it clearly: We need to add 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 by Discount Hawaiian Gifts to the wish list.

Looking at the observation, it seems we've already made significant progress. The item is already in the wish list, and the quantity is set to 2. This is exactly what we wanted to achieve. Let's break this down:

1. The item "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts" is present in the wish list (ID 11927).
2. The quantity for this item is set to 2 (visible in the spinbutton with ID 11570).
3. There's an alert message saying the item has been added to the wish list (ID 8320).

This suggests that our previous actions have successfully accomplished the task. We've added the correct item to the wish list and set the quantity to 2.

Now, I'm wondering if we need to do anything else. The "Update Wish List" button (ID 11694) is present, which might suggest we need to confirm the changes. However, given that the alert message already confirms the item has been added, and the quantity is correctly set, it's possible that no further action is required.

To be absolutely certain, let's consider our options:

1. We could click the "Update Wish List" button to ensure all changes are saved.
2. We could simply stop here, as the objective appears to be met.

I'm leaning towards option 2, as all the evidence suggests our task is complete. The item is in the wish list, the quantity is correct, and we've received a confirmation message.

Let's proceed with stopping and confirming our success.

This reminds me of a key principle in task completion: always verify that all requirements have been met before concluding. In this case, we've done exactly that - we've added the correct item and set the right quantity.

I think we can confidently say we've completed the objective successfully.
```

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task.

Observations: The current observation shows that the user is already on the "My Wish List" page.

External Knowledge2, while related to adding items to a wish list, describes a different product (Sceptre TV) and a scenario where the task has already been completed.

The most appropriate action can be determined solely from the current observation.\n\nUseful External Knowledge: []\n```\n\nBased on this analysis, none of the provided External Knowledge pieces are particularly useful for predicting the next action in this specific scenario.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [11386]
|	reason for action [0]:
After identifying the product with the lowest per unit price, we need to add it to the cart.

|	action [1]:
note [Reviewing gathered information to identify the product with the lowest per unit price]
|	reason for action [1]:
We have already gathered information on all products and need to identify the one with the lowest per unit price.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let me carefully analyze the current situation and our progress towards the objective...

First, I need to review our plan progress. We've been following a plan to find the product with the lowest per unit price and add it to the cart. Let's see how far we've gotten:

- plan [0]
	[0,1,2] We successfully navigated through all product pages, gathering information on 24 products
	[3] We made a note to calculate per unit prices, but haven't actually done the calculations yet

So we've made good progress in gathering data, but we haven't completed the crucial step of calculating and comparing per unit prices. This is why we haven't achieved our objective yet.

Now, let's assess the proposed actions:

- action [0]: click [11386]
This action would add the "Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit" to the cart. The value of this action is low because we haven't determined if this is the product with the lowest per unit price. The risk is high - we might add the wrong product to the cart. Best case: We accidentally choose the correct product. Worst case: We add the wrong product and fail our objective.

- action [1]: note [Reviewing gathered information to identify the product with the lowest per unit price]
This action has high value as it's the next logical step in our plan. We need to review our data and calculate per unit prices to identify the best product. The risk is low - we're not making any irreversible changes. Best case: We successfully identify the product with the lowest per unit price. Worst case: We might make a calculation error, but we can always double-check our work.

Considering these assessments, action [1] is clearly the better choice. It moves us closer to our goal without any significant risks. We need to complete this step before we can confidently add any product to the cart.

Therefore, I'll select action [1]. This will allow us to review our gathered information, calculate per unit prices, and identify the product we should add to the cart.
```

ACTION SELECTION:

--------------------------------JUDGE--------------------------------
INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements

2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are a seasoned web navigator. You now assess the value and risk of serveral web navigation actions based on the objective, the previous interaction history and the web's current state. Then, you select the action with the most value and least risk with which you would earn the maximum objective fulfillment reward in the future.

Adhere to the following output format:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
Review critically why the plans have not been fulfilled or the objective achieved. Justify your assessment with detailed evidence drawn from the objective, observations, and actions taken. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

ACTION CHOICES:
|	action [0]:
click [11694]
|	reason for action [0]:
Although the task appears complete, we could click the "Update Wish List" button to ensure all changes are saved.

|	action [1]:
stop [The task is complete. 2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts have been successfully added to the wish list with a quantity of 2.]
|	reason for action [1]:
The objective has been fully met - the correct item is in the wish list with the desired quantity of 2. No further action is needed.


RESPONSE:
Here's my comprehensive analysis and action selection:

```thinking
Alright, let's carefully assess our progress and the current situation...

First, I need to review why our plan hasn't been fully fulfilled yet, even though we've made significant progress. 

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[0, 1] [Search successful, item found] [Milestone of finding the item achieved]
	[1] [Item added to wish list] [Milestone of adding item to wish list achieved]
	[2, 3, 4] [Quantity adjusted to 2] [Milestone of setting correct quantity achieved]

It looks like we've actually completed all the necessary steps to fulfill our objective. We've found the item, added it to the wish list, and set the quantity to 2. The plan has been successfully executed.

Now, let's assess our action choices:

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Medium value, as it ensures changes are saved, but may be unnecessary] [Low risk, as it's a standard operation] [Best case: Confirms our changes are saved] [Worst case: Unnecessary action that doesn't change anything]
- action [1]: [High value, as it correctly concludes the task] [Low risk, as all objectives have been met] [Best case: Successfully completes the task] [Worst case: Prematurely ends if there's an unseen issue]

Analyzing these options:

1. Clicking "Update Wish List" (action [0]):
   This action has some merit as it would ensure all our changes are saved. However, based on typical e-commerce functionality, changes to the wish list (like quantity adjustments) are often saved automatically. The current observation shows the quantity as 2, which suggests our change has already been applied.

2. Stopping the task (action [1]):
   This action seems most appropriate. We've successfully completed all parts of our objective:
   - We found the "2 Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid Roots #zc50 - by Discount Hawaiian Gifts"
   - We added it to the wish list
   - We set the quantity to 2

   The current observation clearly shows the item in the wish list with a quantity of 2, which exactly matches our objective.

Considering the completeness of our task and the clear evidence in the current observation, I believe the most appropriate action is to conclude the task.

ACTION SELECTION:
1

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's think through this task step by step:

1. Rephrasing the objective:
We need to find the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs and add it to the shopping cart.

2. Current situation:
We're on the main page of One Stop Market, showing the first 12 out of 24 products. We've already viewed both pages of products and gathered information on all items.

3. What we've done so far:
- Viewed all 24 products across two pages
- Noted that we need to calculate per unit prices
- Noted that we need to review gathered information to identify the lowest per unit price

4. What we need to do next:
- Calculate the per unit price for each product
- Identify the product with the lowest per unit price
- Navigate to that product's page
- Add it to the cart

Let's start by calculating the per unit prices:

1. Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit: $19.99 for 34 oz = $0.59/oz
2. V8 Energy Drink: $14.47 for 24 8oz cans = $0.075/oz
3. Elmwood Inn Fine Teas: $19.36 for 16 oz = $1.21/oz
4. Belle Of The Ball Sprinkle Mix: $23.50 for 8 oz = $2.94/oz
5. So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip: $15.62 for 9 oz = $1.74/oz
6. Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder: $34.00 for 1000g (2x500g) = $0.034/g
7. Q Mixers Ginger Ale: $68.50 for 24 6.7oz bottles = $0.43/oz
8. Stove Top Turkey Stuffing Mix: $8.49 for 24 oz (2x12oz) = $0.35/oz
9. Briess DME - Pilsen Light: $12.99 for 1 lb (16 oz) = $0.81/oz
10. Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning: $7.92 for 14 oz = $0.57/oz
11. Lobster Cobbler Pot Pie: $411.76 for 8 trays (unknown weight)
12. Crunchy Rice Rollers: $11.50 for 14 oz (4x3.5oz) = $0.82/oz

The product with the lowest per unit price is the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder at $0.034 per gram.

Now that we've identified the product, we need to add it to the cart. Fortunately, we're already on the page with this product, so we can proceed directly to adding it to the cart.

This is interesting because we've completed most of the analytical work mentally, and now we just need to perform the action of adding the item to the cart. Let's do that next.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
We have viewed all 24 products across two pages of the One Stop Market website. We've noted the need to calculate per unit prices and review the gathered information to identify the product with the lowest per unit price. We have now completed these calculations mentally.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current page displays 12 products from the One Stop Market. Each product listing includes the product name, price, and sometimes rating information. The Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder, which we've identified as having the lowest per unit price, is listed with a price of $34.00 and has an "Add to Cart" button (ID: 11430).

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: [We have identified the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder as the product with the lowest per unit price, and it's available on the current page. Adding it to the cart will complete our objective.]
- action: [click [11430]]

- reason: [We could navigate to the product's specific page for more details before adding it to the cart, but this is unnecessary as we already have all the required information.]
- action: [click [10641]]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
11430, 10641, 10683

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully analyze this interaction and observation data to understand what\'s happening and predict the key steps and overall purpose...\n\nFirst, I see this is an e-commerce website called "One Stop Market". The user, Emma Lopez, is logged in and browsing product listings on what seems to be the main page.\n\nThe instruction given is to "Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart". This suggests the user wants to find the best deal among the products they\'re currently viewing.\n\nLooking at the product listings, I see 12 different food/beverage items displayed with prices, ratings, and "Add to Cart" buttons. To fulfill the instruction, we\'d need to:\n\n1. Identify all the products and their prices\n2. Calculate the per unit price for each (if unit sizes are given)\n3. Compare to find the lowest per unit price\n4. Add that item to the cart\n\nHowever, there\'s a key limitation - we don\'t have unit size information for most products, making accurate price comparison impossible. The instruction also mentions "open tabs" which we can\'t see in this single page view.\n\nGiven these constraints, the trajectory would likely involve:\n\n1. Scanning the visible product listings\n2. Identifying the lowest absolute price item (Stove Top Turkey Stuffing at $8.49)\n3. Clicking the "Add to Cart" button for that item\n\nThe higher-level purpose seems to be finding the best deal or most economical purchase option among the products the user is considering. This aligns with common online shopping behavior of price comparison and seeking value.\n\nBut I should note that without full information on unit sizes or the ability to see other open tabs, we can\'t be certain of truly finding the lowest per unit price item as instructed. The action taken would be a best effort based on limited visible information.\n```\n\nBased on the available information and the given instruction, here\'s a brief summary of the likely significant steps and the overall purpose:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. Scan the visible product listings on the One Stop Market page\n2. Identify the item with the lowest absolute price (Stove Top Turkey Stuffing at $8.49)\n3. Click the "Add to Cart" button for this item\n\nHigher-level purpose:\nThe goal of these actions is to find the most economical purchase option among the products the user is considering and add it to the shopping cart. This aligns with the common online shopping behavior of price comparison and seeking the best value. However, it\'s important to note that due to limitations in the available information (lack of unit sizes for most products and inability to see other open tabs), the action taken is a best effort based on the visible data rather than a guaranteed selection of the lowest per unit price item across all open tabs.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'One Stop Market\'\n\tlink [10454] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [10450] \'My Wish List 4 items\'\n\tlink [10456] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [10380] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [10389] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [10463] \'My Cart\'\n\tcombobox [10694] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [11502] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [10697] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [9840]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[10308] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [10304] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [10300] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [10296] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [10292] \'Office Products\'; [10288] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [10284] \'Health & Household\'; [10280] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [10276] \'Electronics\'; [10272] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [10268] \'Video Games\'; [10264] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'One Stop Market\'\n\t\ttext \'Product Showcases\'\n\t\tlink [10614] \'Pre-baked Gingerbread House Kit Value Pack, 17 oz., Pack of 2, Total 34 oz.\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 20\'\n\t\t\tlink [11380] \'1 Review\'\n\t\ttext \'19.99\'\n\t\tbutton [11386] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10119] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10479] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10618] \'V8 Energy, Healthy Energy Drink, Steady Energy from Black and Green Tea, Pomegranate Blueberry, 8 Ounce Can ,Pack of 24\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 57\'\n\t\t\tlink [11389] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'14.47\'\n\t\tbutton [11395] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10133] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10491] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10622] \'Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, Orange Vanilla Caffeine-free Fruit Infusion, 16-Ounce Pouch\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 95\'\n\t\t\tlink [11398] \'4 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'19.36\'\n\t\tbutton [11404] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10147] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10503] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10626] \'Belle Of The Ball Princess Sprinkle Mix Wedding Colorful Sprinkles Cake Cupcake Cookie Sprinkles Ice cream Candy Sprinkles Yellow Gold Red Royal Red Rose Icing Flowers Decorating Sprinkles, 8OZ\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\ttext \'Rating: 63\'\n\t\t\tlink [11407] \'12 Reviews\'\n\t\ttext \'23.50\'\n\t\tbutton [11413] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [10161] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [10511] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [10632] \'So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip Light, Vegan, Non-GMO Project Verified, 9 oz.

The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123].

By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS.

The external knowledge examples don't provide information about comparing prices across tabs or finding the lowest per unit price, which is the core of our current task.\n\nWhile the external knowledge demonstrates how to navigate a shopping website and add items to a cart, it doesn't specifically address the unique aspects of our current situation, such as:\n1.

--------------------------------JUDGE--------------------------------
INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are a seasoned web navigator. You now assess the value and risk of serveral web navigation actions based on the objective, the previous interaction history and the web's current state. Then, you select the action with the most value and least risk with which you would earn the maximum objective fulfillment reward in the future.

Adhere to the following output format:
PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
Review critically why the plans have not been fulfilled or the objective achieved. Justify your assessment with detailed evidence drawn from the objective, observations, and actions taken. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- plan [{plan_id}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_a_not_successful}]\n\t[{step_ids_taken_for_this_milestone}] [{concrete_proof_from_observation}] [{why_milestone_b_not_successful}]\n\t...`.
ACTION ASSESSMENT:
Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
ACTION SELECTION:
List the numerical id of your selected action here. You can only choose one action. You must follow the format E.g., `1`.

Note that `branch` and `prune` are planning actions that will modify the PREVIOUS PLAN section and won't interact with the web environment.

click [11430]
|	reason for action [1]:
We have identified the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder as the product with the lowest per unit price, and it's available on the current page. Adding it to the cart will complete our objective.


RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's carefully analyze our progress and the current situation:

First, I need to review why we haven't fully achieved our objective yet. We've made good progress, but there's a critical step missing...

PLAN PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:
- plan [0]
	[3] [Calculating per unit prices for all products] This step was necessary, but I don't see any concrete evidence that we actually performed the calculations. We gathered the information, but didn't process it.
	[4] [Reviewing gathered information to identify the product with the lowest per unit price] Again, this step was noted, but I don't see any evidence of the actual review or identification process in our observations.

Hmm, it seems we've noted these crucial steps but haven't actually carried them out in detail. That's a significant oversight on my part. I should have realized this earlier and performed the calculations explicitly. Let me rectify that now...

I'll quickly calculate the per unit prices for all products we've seen:

1. Gingerbread House Kit: $19.99 / 34 oz = $0.59/oz
2. V8 Energy Drink: $14.47 / (24 * 8 oz) = $0.08/oz
3. Elmwood Inn Tea: $19.36 / 16 oz = $1.21/oz
4. Belle Of The Ball Sprinkles: $23.50 / 8 oz = $2.94/oz
5. So Delicious CocoWhip: $15.62 / 9 oz = $1.74/oz
6. Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch: $34.00 / 1000g = $0.034/g
7. Q Mixers Ginger Ale: $68.50 / (24 * 6.7 oz) = $0.43/oz
8. Stove Top Stuffing: $8.49 / 24 oz = $0.35/oz
9. Briess DME: $12.99 / 16 oz = $0.81/oz
10. Tony Chachere's Seasoning: $7.92 / 14 oz = $0.57/oz
11. Lobster Cobbler Pot Pie: $411.76 / 8 trays (unknown weight)
12. Crunchy Rice Rollers: $11.50 / (4 * 3.5 oz) = $0.82/oz

Now, reviewing this information, I can see that the V8 Energy Drink has the lowest per unit price at $0.08/oz. The Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch, which I previously thought was the lowest, is actually $0.034/g, which is roughly $0.96/oz (assuming 1 oz ≈ 28.35g), making it more expensive per unit than the V8 Energy Drink.

This realization changes our action plan significantly. We should be adding the V8 Energy Drink to the cart, not the Sweet Potato Starch.

ACTION ASSESSMENT:
- action [0]: [Low value, low risk] Clicking on the Sweet Potato Starch product link would provide more details, but it's unnecessary and would take us away from the correct product. [Best case: We get more product details] [Worst case: We waste time and need to navigate back]
- action [1]: [Low value, medium risk] Adding the Sweet Potato Starch to the cart would be a mistake as it's not the product with the lowest per unit price. [Best case: We add a product to the cart, but not the correct one] [Worst case: We complete the objective incorrectly]

Neither of these actions is correct given our new understanding. We need to add the V8 Energy Drink to the cart instead.

ACTION SELECTION:
Unfortunately, I cannot select either of the given actions as they do not lead to fulfilling our objective correctly. The correct action would be to click the "Add to Cart" button for the V8 Energy Drink, but this option is not provided in the current action choices.

Given the constraints, I must refrain from selecting an action and instead explain that we need a different action to correctly fulfill the objective: clicking the "Add to Cart" button (with id [11395]) for the V8 Energy Drink.
```

I apologize, but I cannot select either of the given actions

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's take a moment to review where we are and what we need to do...

We're currently on the product page for the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder. This is the item we identified as having the lowest per unit price from all the products we reviewed earlier. Our task is to add this product to the shopping cart.

The page layout looks pretty standard for an e-commerce product page. We've got the product name, price, availability, and most importantly, an "Add to Cart" button. That's exactly what we need.

The price shown is $34.00, which matches what we saw on the product listing page. That's good - it confirms we're on the right product page and the price hasn't changed.

I see a quantity selector (ID: 13505) set to 1, which is fine for our purposes. We just need to add one unit to the cart.

The "Add to Cart" button (ID: 13506) is right there, clearly visible and likely interactive. This is definitely the element we want to interact with to complete our task.

I don't think we need to do anything else here. We've already compared prices across all products, identified this as the lowest per unit price, and now we're ready to add it to the cart. Let's go ahead and do that.

ACTION CANDIDATES:
- reason: We have identified the product with the lowest per unit price and are now on its product page. The "Add to Cart" button is visible and likely interactive.
- action: click [13506]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
13506, 13505, 13126, 13371

Now, let's execute this action and add the product to the cart.
```

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': "Here is my analysis of the trajectory based on the given information:\n\n```thinking\nHmm, let me think through this carefully...\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the instruction and observations are telling me. The instruction is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from open tabs to the shopping cart. But the observations only show one product page - for Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder.\n\nThis is interesting because it doesn't quite match the instruction. We don't have information about multiple open tabs or different product prices to compare. We only see details for this one specific product.\n\nSo what can I infer about the trajectory? Well, it seems the user (Emma Lopez) has navigated to this product page. The page shows details like the product name, price ($34.00), availability (in stock), and options to add to cart.\n\nThe key elements I'm seeing are:\n1. User is logged in (welcome message for Emma Lopez)\n2. On a product page for sweet potato starch powder\n3. Product is in stock and priced at $34.00\n4. There's an option to add to cart\n\nGiven the instruction, I would expect the next action to be adding this item to the cart. But I don't have confirmation that this actually happened.\n\nSo in summarizing the trajectory, I need to be careful not to assume actions that aren't explicitly stated. I should focus on what we can clearly see from the observations.\n```\n\nBriefly summarizing the significant steps or actions taken throughout the trajectory:\n\n1. User Emma Lopez logged into the e-commerce website.\n2. Navigated to the product page for Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder.\n3. Viewed product details including price, availability, and purchase options.\n\nProviding a higher-level abstraction of the purpose or goal of the trajectory actions:\n\nThe overall purpose appears to be product research and potential purchase preparation. The user has accessed a specific product page, suggesting they are interested in this item and considering whether to add it to their cart. This aligns with typical e-commerce browsing and shopping behavior, where users examine product details before making a purchase decision.", 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder 500g, 2ea(Sweet Potato 55, Corn 45)\'\n\tlink [13354] \'My Account\'\n\tlink [13350] \'My Wish List 4 items\'\n\tlink [13356] \'Sign Out\'\n\ttext \'Welcome, Emma Lopez!\'\n\tlink [13250] \'Skip to Content\'\n\tlink [13259] \'store logo\'\n\tlink [13363] \'My Cart\'\n\tcombobox [13532] \'Search\' [required: False]\n\tlink [14245] \'Advanced Search\'\n\tbutton [13535] \'Search\' [disabled: True]\n\ttablist [12977]\n\t\ttabpanel\n\t\t\tmenu "[13174] \'Beauty & Personal Care\'; [13170] \'Sports & Outdoors\'; [13166] \'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry\'; [13162] \'Home & Kitchen\'; [13158] \'Office Products\'; [13154] \'Tools & Home Improvement\'; [13150] \'Health & Household\'; [13146] \'Patio, Lawn & Garden\'; [13142] \'Electronics\'; [13138] \'Cell Phones & Accessories\'; [13134] \'Video Games\'; [13130] \'Grocery & Gourmet Food\'"\n\tlink [13285] \'Home\'\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder 500g, 2ea(Sweet Potato 55, Corn 45)\'\n\t\tgeneric [13126] \'Availability\'\n\t\t\ttext \'IN STOCK\'\n\t\ttext \'SKU\'\n\t\ttext \'B07Y4MC6M5\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\tlink [13371] \'Be the first to review this product\'\n\t\ttext \'34.00\'\n\t\tLayoutTable\n\t\t\tspinbutton [13505] \'Qty\' [required: False] [valuemin: 0] [valuemax: 0] [valuetext: ]\n\t\t\t\ttext \'1\'\n\t\t\tbutton [13506] \'Add to Cart\'\n\t\tlink [13315] \'Add to Wish List\'\n\t\tlink [13316] \'Add to Compare\'\n\t\tlink [13322] \'Skip to the end of the images gallery\'\n\t\tlink [13326] \'Skip to the beginning of the images gallery\'\n\t\ttablist [13113]\n\t\t\ttab [13327] \'Details\' [selected: False]\n\t\t\t\tlink [13386] \'Details\'\n\t\t\ttabpanel \'Details\'\n\t\t\t\theading \'Product Quick Look\'\n\t\t\t\tListMarker [13122]\n\t\t\t\ttext \'Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder 500g, 2ea(Sweet Potato 55, Corn 45)\'\n\t\t\t\ttable\n\t\t\t\t\trow \'| Item Weight | UPC | Manufacturer | ASIN |  |\'\n\t\t\t\t\trow \'| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\'\n\t\t\t\t\trow \'| 1.1 Pounds | 649670249366 | Cheogeun | B07Y4MC6M5 |  |\'\n\t\t\ttab [13328] \'Reviews\' [selected: False]\n\t\t\t\tlink [13388] \'Reviews\'\n\tcontentinfo\n\t\ttextbox [13519] \'Sign Up for Our Newsletter:\' [required: False]\n\t\tbutton [13469] \'Subscribe\'\n\t\tlink [13470] \'Privacy and Cookie Policy\'\n\t\tlink [13471] \'Search Terms\'\n\t\tlink [13472] \'Advanced Search\'\n\t\tlink [13473] \'Contact Us\'\n\t\ttext \'Copyright 2013-present Magento, Inc.

The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical.

While not directly applicable, it demonstrates a process of identifying the lowest-priced item on a page and adding it to the cart, which is relevant to our current task.\n\nEvaluation:\n1. External Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 are not useful for the current task as they deal with an unrelated product category and scenario.\n\n2. External Knowledge2 is somewhat useful as it outlines a similar process of finding and adding the lowest-priced item to a cart. It shows the general approach of:\n   a) Identifying the lowest-priced item on the current page\n   b) Adding that item to the cart\n   c) Attempting to navigate to other sections/tabs to compare prices\n\nThis aligns with our current task, although we\'ve already completed steps a and b. The useful part is the suggestion to navigate to other tabs or sections to continue price comparison, which is relevant to our need to check other open tabs.\n\nConclusion:\nOnly External Knowledge2 has some value for predicting the next action. It suggests that after adding the lowest-priced item from the current page, the next step should be to attempt to navigate to other tabs or sections to continue the price comparison process.\n\nUseful External knowledge: [External Knowledge2]\n```\n\nThe useful External knowledge is [External Knowledge2].'}

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
ACTION CANDIDATES:
Propose ALL potential good actions at this step. even if there is only one action, it must follow this format. Itemize the actions using this format: `- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action0}]\n- action: [{action0_command}]\n\n- reason: [{reason_for_proposing_the_following_action1}]\n- action: [{action1_command}]\n\n...`.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can't choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don't need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website. We give you the right website, please just explore. This task must 100% can be completed without requesting external information or human assistance. Required information should be obtained through your own actions. Keep exploring different approaches until you succeed - never give up or wait for human input.

RAG EXAMPLES:
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR REFERENCE: this is some example (or empty) you can refer to to complete the task (please do not mix the ids and descriptions and urls in the examples with our current webpage observation. In each example, first come observation and objective, then come the action and reason, then come next observation, and so on. But we are not sure wether these example is good or bad, learn from it and you need to make your own action):[[{"External Knowledge0": "\nSummarized Instructions:\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\nThe trajectory begins on a webpage displaying cell phones and accessories. The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \"Dilwe1 12'' Phone Screen Magnifier\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \"Add to Cart\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn't appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\n\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\n\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they've made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\n\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\n\nEvaluation:\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn't successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don't contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\n\n**yes**\n\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"heap\",\n    \"objective\": \"Add the product

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Alright, let's process this observation and determine our next steps:

1. Rephrasing the human message: The objective is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the shopping cart.

2. Initial impressions: We've successfully identified the product with the lowest per unit price (Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder) and added it to the cart. The alert message confirms this action: "You added Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder 500g, 2ea(Sweet Potato 55, Corn 45) to your shopping cart."

3. Broader context: We've completed the main task of finding the lowest-priced item and adding it to the cart. Now we need to confirm if any additional steps are required or if we should conclude the task.

4. Known elements: The product is in the cart, and we're on the product page.
   Unknown elements: Whether we need to view the cart or perform any additional actions.

5. Why the human might ask this: They want to ensure they're getting the best deal across all available products.

6. Relevant knowledge: E-commerce workflows typically end with viewing the cart or proceeding to checkout after adding an item.

7. Potential ambiguities: Whether we need to explicitly view the cart or if adding to the cart is sufficient to complete the task.

Breaking down the components:
1. Find the lowest per unit price product (completed)
2. Add that product to the cart (completed)
3. Confirm the addition (completed via alert message)

The successful response would be confirming that we've added the lowest-priced item to the cart, which we've done.

Multiple hypotheses:
1. The task is complete, and we should stop here.
2. We should view the cart to double-check the addition.
3. We need to proceed to checkout.

Given the specific wording of the objective, which was to "Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart," it seems we've fulfilled this requirement. The alert message confirms the addition to the cart, so viewing the cart isn't strictly necessary.

Testing this conclusion: The objective doesn't mention viewing the cart or proceeding to checkout, just adding the item to the cart.

Error recognition: I don't see any errors in our process. We systematically compared prices, identified the lowest per unit price item, and added it to the cart.

Knowledge synthesis: We've successfully completed all steps required by the objective.

Considering potential follow-up questions, the human might want to know which product was added and at what price. We have this information available.

Given all this, I believe we've completed the task and should stop the interaction, providing a summary of our actions.
```

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:

RAG LOG:
{'id': ['instructions_435_obs1_obs3'], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me analyze this carefully...\n\nFirst, I need to understand what\'s happening in this observation. It seems to be a product page for "Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder 500g, 2ea(Sweet Potato 55, Corn 45)" on an e-commerce website. \n\nThe key elements I\'m noticing:\n1. The product is already in the shopping cart, as evidenced by the alert message "You added Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder 500g, 2ea(Sweet Potato 55, Corn 45) to your shopping cart."\n2. The price is listed as $34.00\n3. There\'s an "Add to Cart" button, but it\'s not clear if it was just clicked or not\n\nNow, thinking about the instruction and the observation:\nThe instruction was to "Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart". However, we only see one product here, and it\'s already in the cart. We don\'t have information about other open tabs or their prices to compare.\n\nThis makes me think that the significant action has already been taken - the product was added to the cart. But without seeing the process of comparing prices or selecting this product, I can\'t be certain this was the lowest per unit price option.\n\nThe higher-level goal seems to be making a purchase decision based on price efficiency, specifically looking for the best value in terms of price per unit across multiple options.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I\'ll summarize what I can confidently infer from the observation.\n```\n\nBased on the observation, the significant action taken was adding the Cheongeun Sweet Potato Starch Powder to the shopping cart. This product, priced at $34.00, is now in the user\'s cart as indicated by the alert message.\n\nThe higher-level purpose appears to be making a purchase decision, potentially based on finding the best value or lowest per unit price among available options. However, without information about other products or tabs, we can\'t confirm if this was indeed the lowest-priced option or how it was selected.', 'external knowledge': '[{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins on a webpage displaying cell phones and accessories. The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

The user identifies the product with the lowest price ($9.73) on the current page, which is a \\"Dilwe1 12\'\' Phone Screen Magnifier\\". Unable to directly compare prices with other open tabs, the user decides to add this item to the cart by clicking the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. The system confirms the addition with an alert message. The user then attempts to navigate to another tab or section by clicking on a tabpanel element, possibly to compare prices on other pages. However, this action doesn\'t appear to change the page significantly, as the subsequent observation shows similar content to the previous one, still displaying cell phone accessories and their prices.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be: \\"Add the lowest-priced item from the visible product listings to the shopping cart, then attempt to navigate to another section or tab to compare prices.\\" The user is tasked with finding the most economical product among the options available, but is limited by their inability to directly access or view other tabs. They make a decision based on the information immediately available, adding the cheapest item they can see to the cart. The subsequent attempt to navigate elsewhere suggests an intention to continue price comparison, possibly to ensure they\'ve made the best choice or to find an even better deal on another page.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It adds the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, but doesn\'t successfully compare across all open tabs as required.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other. The user adds the lowest-priced item they can see, then attempts to navigate elsewhere, presumably to continue comparison.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior of adding an item to a cart and trying to navigate to other sections for comparison.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach is reasonable given the limitations of not being able to directly switch between tabs. The user makes the best decision possible with the information available.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Add

The system message will tell it what it can do, instruction is our final goal, interaction history is some finished steps, observation is what we see now, and based on these thing we want gpt model to predict next action to achieve our goal. \n                Here is some action choice and meaning:\n                click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn\'t trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element\'s lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.\n                go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.\n                stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn\'t require a textual answer or appears insurmountable or finally find no answer(for example if there is no product processing or no place nearby, you can\'t choose a not correct answer), must indicate "N/A"! must indicate "N/A"! and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [N/A ...]`. If return the direct response textual answer within brackets, The response should be the exact value/token without any additional description or explanation, E.g., For a token request, use stop [ABC_123] not stop [The token is ABC_123]. You don\'t need to do more exploration after finisded the task, just finished the task.\n                note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`\n                type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can\'t find what you\'re looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.\n                branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`\n                prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`\n                We additonally add External knowledge as a example to help finished the task. Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations. Should focus on helpful not just releted. If any External knowledges are useful, identify which ones have value and explain why they are useful.

Instruction: The task is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from open tabs to the shopping cart.\n\n2. Interaction History: The user has already added the lowest-priced item ($9.73) from the current tab to the cart.\n\n3. Observations: We're still on the same page of cell phones and accessories, with the added item confirmation visible.\n\nNow, let's look at the External knowledge provided:\n\nExternal Knowledge0: This knowledge is about drafting a refund message for a kitchen organizer. It's not relevant to our current task of finding the lowest-priced item across tabs and adding it to the cart.\n\nExternal Knowledge1: This knowledge is about filling a contact form for a refund on a phone screen protector. While it's related to the general domain (cell phones and accessories), it doesn't provide any useful information for our specific task.\n\nExternal Knowledge2: This knowledge provides a summary of actions taken to add the lowest-priced item from the visible products to the cart, which aligns with our current task. It mentions the limitation of not being able to directly switch between tabs, which is relevant to our situation. It also suggests that the user attempts to navigate elsewhere after adding the item, presumably to continue comparison.\n\nEvaluation:\nExternal Knowledge0 and External Knowledge1 are not useful for our current task.\n\nExternal Knowledge2 is potentially useful because:\n1. It confirms that the lowest-priced item from the visible products has been added to the cart, which aligns with the action we've observed.\n2. It highlights the limitation of not being able to directly switch between tabs, which is crucial for understanding the constraints of the current environment.\n3. It suggests a next step of attempting to navigate elsewhere to continue price comparison, which could be a valid approach for our task.\n\nTherefore, the useful External knowledge is:\n\n[External knowledge2]\n\nThis knowledge can help another GPT model predict that the next action might involve attempting to navigate to another tab or section to compare prices, which is necessary to fulfill the instruction of finding the lowest-priced item across all open tabs.\n```\n\n[External knowledge2]"}
