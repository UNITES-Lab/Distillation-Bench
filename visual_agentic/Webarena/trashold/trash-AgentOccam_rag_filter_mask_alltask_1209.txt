INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Let me analyze the current situation and figure out the best action to check out the todos:

1. Rephrasing the objective: The human wants me to check out their todos or to-do list on this GitLab dashboard.

2. Initial impressions:
   - We're on a GitLab Projects Dashboard page
   - There's a "To-Do List" link in the navigation
   - The "To-Do List" link shows a count of 20 todos

3. Broader context:
   - GitLab is a platform for software development and project management
   - Todos in GitLab are typically related to assigned tasks, merge requests, or issues

4. Known elements:
   - There's a direct link to the To-Do List
   - The todo count is visible
   - We're currently on the Projects page

5. Unknown elements:
   - The specific contents of the to-do list
   - Any filters or organization within the to-do list

6. Why the human might ask this:
   - They want to review their pending tasks
   - They might be planning their work or checking for updates

7. Relevant knowledge:
   - In GitLab, todos are automatically created for various events like being assigned an issue or mentioned in a comment
   - The to-do list is a centralized place to track these notifications

8. Potential ambiguities:
   - The human might want just the count or the full list of todos
   - They might be interested in a specific type of todo (e.g., only assigned issues)

Given this analysis, the most direct and efficient action to check out the todos would be to click on the "To-Do List" link. This will take us directly to the page where we can view all the todos in detail.

The element we need to interact with is:
link [521] 'To-Do List'
    generic [1609] 'Todos count'
        text '20'

This link not only leads to the To-Do List but also shows that there are 20 todos, which is valuable information to note.

I'll proceed with clicking this link to navigate to the To-Do List page.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
This is the initial interaction, so there is no previous history to summarize.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current observation shows a GitLab Projects Dashboard. The page contains a navigation bar with several links, including "Dashboard", "Issues", "Merge requests", and importantly, a "To-Do List" link. The "To-Do List" link displays a count of 20 todos. The main content of the page shows a list of projects with various details such as stars, forks, and last update times.

REASON:
Based on the objective to "Check out my todos", the most direct and efficient action is to click on the "To-Do List" link. This link is clearly visible in the navigation bar and already shows that there are 20 todos pending. Clicking this link will likely take us to a detailed view of all the todos, which is exactly what we need to fulfill the objective.

ACTION:
click [521]

OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me analyze this carefully. The observation appears to be of a GitLab projects dashboard interface. The user has requested to "Check out my todos", so I need to focus on that aspect while summarizing the key elements I\'m seeing.\n\nLooking at the structure, I notice there\'s a navigation bar at the top with various links. One of these is particularly relevant:\n\nlink [521] \'To-Do List\'\n    generic [1609] \'Todos count\'\n        text \'20\'\n\nThis indicates there are 20 todo items for the user. That\'s a key piece of information directly related to the user\'s request.\n\nThe rest of the page seems to be listing various projects, both public and private. While interesting, this isn\'t directly related to the todos, so I won\'t focus on that in my summary.\n\nThe user didn\'t actually navigate to the todo list in this observation - they\'re still on the projects dashboard. So the action taken was essentially just viewing the dashboard, which happened to show the todo count.\n\nAs for the higher-level purpose, it seems the user wanted to check their outstanding tasks or items that need attention. The GitLab todo list typically contains things like assigned issues, merge requests that need review, or mentions in comments. So the goal was likely to get a quick overview of pending work or notifications.\n\nI should mention that while we can see the todo count, we don\'t have details on the actual todos. The user would need to click through to the To-Do List to see those specifics.\n```\n\nBased on the observation, here\'s a summary of the significant action and the overall purpose:\n\nSignificant action:\n- Viewed the GitLab projects dashboard, which displays a count of 20 todo items in the navigation bar.\n\nHigher-level purpose:\nThe user aimed to check their outstanding tasks or items needing attention in GitLab. While they didn\'t access the detailed todo list, they were able to see that there are 20 pending items. This quick check allows the user to gauge their current workload or determine if there are urgent matters requiring their attention within the GitLab system.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Check out my todos\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'Projects Dashboard GitLab\'\n\tlink [271] \'Skip to content\'\n\tlink [401] \'Dashboard\'\n\tbutton [509]\n\ttextbox [2109] \'Search GitLab\' [required: False]\n\tgeneric [2071] \'Use the shortcut key kbd//kbd to start a search\'\n\tlink [516] \'Create new...\'\n\tlink [518] \'Issues\'\n\t\tgeneric [1591] \'17 assigned issues\'\n\tlink [519] \'Merge requests\'\n\t\tgeneric [1593] \'10 merge requests\'\n\tlink [521] \'To-Do List\'\n\t\tgeneric [1609] \'Todos count\'\n\t\t\ttext \'20\'\n\tlink [522] \'Help\'\n\tlink [524] \'Byte Blaze\'\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'Projects\'\n\t\tlink [377] \'New project\'\n\t\tlink [526] \'Yours 64\'\n\t\tlink [527] \'Starred 11\'\n\t\tlink [528] \'Explore\'\n\t\tlink [529] \'Topics\'\n\t\tsearchbox [384] \'Filter by name\'\n\t\tbutton [457] \'Most stars\'\n\t\tlink [573] \'All\'\n\t\tlink [574] \'Personal\'\n\t\tlink [575] \'D\'\n\t\tlink [582] \'Primer / design\'\n\t\tgeneric [580] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\ttext \'Developer\'\n\t\ttext \'Primer Design Guidelines\'\n\t\tlink [605] \'22\'\n\t\tlink [606] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [607] \'18\'\n\t\tlink [608] \'21\'\n\t\ttime \'Dec 8, 2024 3:43pm EST\'\n\t\t\ttext \'2 days ago\'\n\t\tlink [621] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [628] \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\n\t\tgeneric [626] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\ttext \'Maintainer\'\n\t\ttext \'The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.\'\n\t\tlink [651] \'21\'\n\t\tlink [652] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [653] \'12\'\n\t\tlink [654] \'46\'\n\t\ttime \'Dec 8, 2024 4:00pm EST\'\n\t\t\ttext \'2 days ago\'\n\t\tlink [667] \'M\'\n\t\tlink [674] \'Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people\'\n\t\tgeneric [672] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\tgeneric [1743] \'snake\'\n\t\ttext "Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of \'Millennials\' with \'Snake People\'"\n\t\tlink [697] \'7\'\n\t\tlink [698] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [699] \'2\'\n\t\tlink [700] \'4\'\n\t\ttime \'Dec 4, 2024 12:02pm EST\'\n\t\t\ttext \'6 days ago\'\n\t\tlink [713] \'E\'\n\t\tlink [720] \'Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts\'\n\t\tgeneric [718] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\tgeneric [1762] \'electric light bulb\'\n\t\ttext \'Ideas to help consider Inclusive Design principles when making things for others to use.\'\n\t\tlink [743] \'6\'\n\t\tlink [744] \'1\'\n\t\tlink [745] \'2\'\n\t\tlink [746] \'9\'\n\t\ttime \'Dec 8, 2024 2:55am EST\'\n\t\t\ttext \'2 days ago\'\n\t\tlink [759] \'E\'\n\t\tlink [766] \'Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website\'\n\t\tgeneric [764] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\tgeneric [1781] \'triangular ruler\'\n\t\ttext \'Repo for my personal website.\'\n\t\tlink [789] \'3\'\n\t\tlink [790] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [791] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [792] \'0\'\n\t\ttime \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\n\t\t\ttext \'1 year ago\'\n\t\tlink [805] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [812] \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\n\t\tgeneric [810] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\tgeneric [1800] \'lipstick\'\n\t\ttext \'Accessible light and dark syntax highlighting themes\'\n\t\tlink [835] \'2\'\n\t\tlink [836] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [837] \'1\'\n\t\tlink [838] \'2\'\n\t\ttime \'Dec 7, 2024 10:40am EST\'\n\t\t\ttext \'3 days ago\'\n\t\tlink [851] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [858] \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\n\t\tgeneric [856] \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\n\t\tgeneric [1819] \'globe with meridians\'\n\t\ttext \'A webring for digital accessibility practitioners.\'\n\t\tlink [881] \'2\'\n\t\tlink [882] \'0\'\n\t\tlink [883] \'1\'\n\t\tlink [884] \'4\'\n\t\ttime \'Dec 7, 2024 11:03am EST\'\n\t\t\ttext \'3 days ago\'\n\t\tlink [897] \'A\'\n\t\tlink [904] \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\n\t\tgeneric [902] \'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

The user identifies a specific merge request titled \\"Add color utility classes\\" and clicks on it. This action navigates the user to a detailed view of the merge request.\\n\\nIn the new view, the user observes various details about the merge request, including its status, description, and previous comments. The user then locates a text box for adding a new comment. The user types \\"Good idea\\" into this comment box.\\n\\nAfter typing the comment, the observation shows that the text \\"Good idea\\" now appears in the comment box, and the \\"Comment\\" button, which was previously disabled, is now enabled. This indicates that the user has successfully entered the desired comment and is now ready to submit it.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to navigate to a specific merge request in a GitLab project and add a supportive comment. The user is tasked with finding a merge request related to adding color utility classes, accessing its detailed view, and leaving a brief positive comment on the proposed changes.\\n\\nThis task involves navigating through a list of merge requests, identifying the correct one based on its title, clicking to view its details, locating the comment input area, and typing a short affirmative message. The trajectory demonstrates the user\'s ability to interact with GitLab\'s interface, understand the context of the merge request, and provide feedback in the form of a comment.\\n\\nThe purpose aligns with common code review practices in collaborative software development environments, where team members review and comment on each other\'s proposed changes before they are merged into the main codebase.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction to post \\"Good idea\\" for the merge request related to color utility in the a11yproject.com project. The user successfully navigates to the correct merge request and types the comment.\\n\\n2. Coherence: Each action logically follows from the previous observation. The user first identifies the correct merge request, then navigates to it, and finally types the comment.\\n\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics natural user behavior when interacting with a GitLab interface to review and comment on a merge request.\\n\\n4. Reasonable: The solution is straightforward and efficient, directly accomplishing the task without unnecessary steps or complications.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Post \\\\\\"Good idea\\\\\\" for the merge request related to color ulitity in a11yproject.com project\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-github.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Merge requests \\u00b7 The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com \\u00b7 GitLab\\\\n\\\\n[4500] RootWebArea \'Merge requests \\u00b7 The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com \\u00b7 GitLab\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[4658] link \'Skip to content\'\\\\n\\\\t[4821] link \'Dashboard\'\\\\n\\\\t[5094] button \'\' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t[6619] textbox \'Search GitLab\' required: False\\\\n\\\\t[6490] generic \'Use the shortcut key <kbd>/</kbd> to start a search\'\\\\n\\\\t[5101] link \'Create new...\'\\\\n\\\\t[5103] link \'Issues\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5561] generic \'14 assigned issues\'\\\\n\\\\t[5104] link \'Merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5563] generic \'8 merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t[5106] link \'To-Do List\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5579] generic \'Todos count\'\\\\n\\\\t[5107] link \'Help\'\\\\n\\\\t[5109] link \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5613] img \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t[4659] complementary \'Project navigation\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4856] listitem \'a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5111] link \'a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5658] StaticText \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5112] link \'Project information\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5114] link \'Repository\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5116] link \'Issues\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5723] StaticText \'41\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5118] link \'Merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5752] StaticText \'10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5120] link \'CI/CD\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5122] link \'Security & Compliance\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5124] link \'Deployments\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5126] link \'Packages and registries\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5128] link \'Infrastructure\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5130] link \'Monitor\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5132] link \'Analytics\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5134] link \'Wiki\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5136] link \'Snippets\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5138] link \'Settings\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4792] button \'Collapse sidebar\'\\\\n\\\\t[4663] navigation \'Breadcrumbs\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5155] link \'The A11Y Project\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5157] link \'a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5159] link \'Merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t[4506] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4896] link \'Open 10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4897] link \'Merged 816\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4898] link \'Closed 87\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4899] link \'All 913\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4802] link \'Subscribe to RSS feed\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4809] group \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4903] button \'Export as CSV\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4804] button \'Edit merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4805] link \'New merge request\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5177] button \'Recent searches\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[6621] textbox \'Search or filter results...\' required: False\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4817] group \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5209] button \'Created date\' hasPopup: listbox\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4913] link \'Sort direction\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4507] complementary \'Bulk update\' live: polite atomic: False relevant: additions text\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5220] link \'Add draft of What is Semantic HTML post\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5222] StaticText \'!1531 \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5223] StaticText \'\\u00b7 created \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4542] time \'Mar 18, 2023 10:00pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[6367] StaticText \'1 year ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5224] StaticText \' by \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5225] link \'David A.

The initial observation shows a link for \\"Review requests for you 5\\" with an ID of 1728. The user clicks this link to access merge requests requiring their review.\\n\\nAfter clicking, the page changes to display a list of merge requests. The new observation shows several merge requests, each with details such as title, project, creation date, author, and update time. Notably, some merge requests are marked with \\"Review requested from Byte Blaze,\\" indicating they require the user\'s attention.\\n\\nThe user identifies three specific merge requests that need their review:\\n1. \\"Feat/toggle checklist groups\\" (updated Mar 23, 2023 4:46am EDT)\\n2. \\"feat: add WCAG levels\\" (updated Mar 27, 2023 7:21pm EDT)\\n3. \\"Fix card focus edge cases\\" (updated Mar 23, 2023 4:46am EDT)\\n\\nThe trajectory concludes with the user listing these merge requests, effectively completing the task of checking out merge requests requiring their review.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to review and identify pending merge requests that require the user\'s attention in a GitLab environment. The task involves navigating from the main dashboard to a specific section dedicated to merge requests awaiting review.\\n\\nThe user is expected to access the GitLab platform, locate the section for review requests, and then examine the list of merge requests to identify those specifically assigned to them. This process includes understanding the interface elements, such as links and buttons, to navigate to the correct page.\\n\\nOnce on the merge requests page, the user needs to analyze the presented information, including titles, creation dates, authors, and update times. The key aspect of this task is to recognize and list the merge requests that are explicitly marked for review by the user, typically indicated by a phrase like \\"Review requested from [User].\\"\\n\\nThe final step of the task involves compiling a list of these relevant merge requests, noting important details such as the title of each request and its last update time. This summary provides a clear overview of the pending work and allows the user to prioritize their review tasks effectively.\\n\\nThis task simulates a common workflow in collaborative software development environments, where team members need to regularly check and review code changes proposed by their colleagues.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. The instruction and trajectory are aligned. The trajectory successfully accomplishes the goal of checking out merge requests requiring the user\'s review.\\n2. The trajectory is coherent. Each action logically follows from the previous observation, and there are no contradictions in the actions.\\n3. The trajectory is natural. It mimics real-world interactions a user would perform when checking merge requests on GitLab.\\n4. The trajectory is reasonable. It efficiently accomplishes the task without unnecessary complications or repetitions.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Checkout merge requests requiring my review\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-github.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\\\\n\\\\n[1] RootWebArea \'Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[235] link \'Skip to content\'\\\\n\\\\t[356] link \'Dashboard\'\\\\n\\\\t[433] button \'\' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t[1709] textbox \'Search GitLab\' required: False\\\\n\\\\t[1670] generic \'Use the shortcut key <kbd>/</kbd> to start a search\'\\\\n\\\\t[440] link \'Create new...\'\\\\n\\\\t[442] link \'Issues\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1247] generic \'14 assigned issues\'\\\\n\\\\t[443] link \'Merge requests\' focused: True expanded: True describedby: gl-tooltip1\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1249] generic \'8 merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t[1729] link \'Assigned to you 3\'\\\\n\\\\t[1728] link \'Review requests for you 5\'\\\\n\\\\t[445] link \'To-Do List\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1265] generic \'Todos count\'\\\\n\\\\t[446] link \'Help\'\\\\n\\\\t[448] link \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1299] img \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t[7] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[338] heading \'Projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[341] link \'New project\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[450] link \'Yours 17\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[451] link \'Starred 3\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[452] link \'Explore\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[453] link \'Topics\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[348] searchbox \'Filter by name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[410] button \'Name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[497] link \'All\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[498] link \'Personal\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[499] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[502] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[505] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[503] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[511] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1359] generic \'lipstick\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1701] StaticText \'\\ud83d\\udc84\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1360] StaticText \' Accessible light and dark syntax highlighting themes\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[523] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[524] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[525] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[526] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[535] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[21] time \'Mar 23, 2024 11:03pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[536] StaticText \'10 hours ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[537] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[540] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[543] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[541] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[549] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1378] generic \'globe with meridians\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1702] StaticText \'\\ud83c\\udf10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1379] StaticText \' A webring for digital accessibility practitioners.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[561] link \'2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[562] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[563] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[564] link \'4\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[573] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[33] time \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[574] StaticText \'11 months ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[575] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[578] heading \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[581] link \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[579] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[587] StaticText \'Maintainer\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[1397] StaticText \'The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[599] link \'21\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[600] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[601] link \'10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[602] link \'41\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[611] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[45] time \'Mar 23, 2024 10:35pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[612] StaticText \'10 hours ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[613] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[616] heading \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[619] link \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[617] generic \'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

The user is presented with a comprehensive view of their projects, including project names, visibility status, and recent activity. The interface also displays links to issues, merge requests, and a to-do list.\\n\\nAfter this initial observation, the action taken is to stop, as there is no clear path to set the GitLab status as \\"Busy\\". The reason provided is that the current view does not offer any direct access to user profile or settings where such a status change option would typically be found. The user notes that the closest potential interaction point for accessing user settings might be a user avatar or name, often located in the top right corner of such interfaces, but this is not visible in the current observation.\\n\\nThe trajectory then shows a second identical observation of the GitLab dashboard, followed by another stop action. The reasoning remains the same - there is no visible option to set the user status to \\"Busy\\" within the current view, and no clear path to navigate to a page where such an option might be available.\\n\\nThroughout the trajectory, no changes are made to the interface or user status, as the required action cannot be completed based on the available information and interface elements.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to attempt to set the user\'s GitLab status as \\"Busy\\". The task involves navigating the GitLab dashboard interface to locate and access user profile settings where status options are typically found. The user is expected to search for a menu, button, or link that would lead to personal settings or a status change feature.\\n\\nHowever, the trajectory reveals that the current view of the GitLab dashboard does not provide a clear path to accomplish this task. The user carefully examines the interface, looking for any elements that might lead to user settings or profile options, such as a user avatar or name typically located in the top right corner of web applications.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates the user\'s thorough inspection of the available options and interface elements, including project lists, navigation menus, and various links to GitLab features like issues and merge requests. Despite this comprehensive examination, the user is unable to find a direct way to change their status to \\"Busy\\".\\n\\nThe purpose also includes the decision-making process of determining when to stop attempting the task due to the lack of necessary interface elements or navigation options. This showcases the user\'s ability to assess the situation and conclude that the current view does not allow for the completion of the intended task, highlighting the importance of clear user interface design for accessibility of common features like status changes.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, the evaluation of the trajectory and instruction is as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction as it attempts to set the GitLab status as \\"Busy\\", but is unable to complete the task due to limitations in the interface.\\n\\n2. Coherence: The trajectory is coherent, with each action (stopping) being logical based on the previous observation.\\n\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics real-world interactions, as a human user would likely inspect the interface and stop when unable to find the necessary options.\\n\\n4. Reasonableness: The trajectory uses a reasonable approach by thoroughly examining the available options before concluding that the task cannot be completed with the current interface.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Set my gitlab status as Busy.\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-github.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\\\\n\\\\n[3852] RootWebArea \'Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[3862] link \'Skip to content\'\\\\n\\\\t[3919] link \'Dashboard\'\\\\n\\\\t[5481] button \'\' hasPopup: menu expanded: True\\\\n\\\\t[5589] list \'\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5628] StaticText \'Switch to\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5606] button \'Projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5579] button \'Groups\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5617] StaticText \'Explore\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5613] link \'Milestones\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5623] link \'Snippets\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5595] link \'Activity\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5643] searchbox \'Search your projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5612] StaticText \'Frequently visited\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5618] StaticText \'Projects you visit often will appear here\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5637] link \'View all projects\'\\\\n\\\\t[5372] textbox \'Search GitLab\' required: False\\\\n\\\\t[5333] generic \'Use the shortcut key <kbd>/</kbd> to start a search\'\\\\n\\\\t[4039] link \'Create new...\'\\\\n\\\\t[4041] link \'Issues\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4910] generic \'14 assigned issues\'\\\\n\\\\t[4042] link \'Merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4912] generic \'8 merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t[4044] link \'To-Do List\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4928] generic \'Todos count\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5354] StaticText \'5\'\\\\n\\\\t[4045] link \'Help\'\\\\n\\\\t[4047] link \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4962] img \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t[3868] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3882] heading \'Projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3885] link \'New project\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4049] link \'Yours 17\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4050] link \'Starred 3\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4051] link \'Explore\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4052] link \'Topics\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3892] searchbox \'Filter by name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3975] button \'Name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4096] link \'All\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4097] link \'Personal\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4098] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4103] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4106] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4104] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4112] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5022] generic \'lipstick\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5364] StaticText \'\\ud83d\\udc84\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5023] StaticText \' Accessible light and dark syntax highlighting themes\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4129] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4130] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4131] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4132] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4142] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4143] time \'Mar 23, 2024 11:03pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4144] StaticText \'10 hours ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4145] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4150] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4153] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4151] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4159] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5041] generic \'globe with meridians\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5365] StaticText \'\\ud83c\\udf10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5042] StaticText \' A webring for digital accessibility practitioners.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4176] link \'2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4177] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4178] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4179] link \'4\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4189] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4190] time \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4191] StaticText \'11 months ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4192] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4197] heading \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4200] link \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4198] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4206] StaticText \'Maintainer\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5060] StaticText \'The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4223] link \'21\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4224] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4225] link \'10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4226] link \'41\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4236] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4237] time \'Mar 24, 2024 9:31am EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4238] StaticText \'3 minutes ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4239] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4244] heading \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4247] link \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4245] generic \'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Okay, let's think through this task step by step:

1. Rephrasing the objective: The human wants me to check out their todos on this GitLab To-Do List Dashboard.

2. Initial impressions: We're already on the To-Do List page, which is perfect for our task. The page shows a list of todos with various details like issues, merge requests, and their status.

3. Context: This appears to be a GitLab project management interface, specifically the To-Do List section. It's designed to help users track tasks, issues, and merge requests that require their attention.

4. Known elements:
   - There are 20 active todos and 11 completed ones.
   - The todos are a mix of issues and merge requests.
   - Each todo item has details like title, project, assignee, and time created.

5. Unknown elements:
   - The specific content or priority of each todo item.
   - Whether the user wants a summary or detailed information about each todo.

6. Why ask this question: The user likely wants to review their outstanding tasks or get an overview of their current workload.

7. Relevant knowledge: GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git-repository manager with wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features.

Now, let's break down the problem and explore the information:

1. We have a clear list of todos, with 20 active items.
2. Each item has a title, associated project, type (issue or merge request), and timestamp.
3. There are options to filter and sort the todos, which could be useful if we need to organize the information.

Multiple interpretations:
1. The user might want a quick summary of the number and types of todos.
2. They might want detailed information about each todo item.
3. They could be looking for specific high-priority or recent items.

Potential approaches:
1. Provide a high-level summary of the todos.
2. List out all the todos with their key details.
3. Focus on the most recent or seemingly important todos.

Let's go with a combination approach - we'll provide a summary and then list out the todos, focusing on the most recent and potentially important ones.

As I analyze the data, I notice:
1. The most recent todo is from 2 days ago, about clarifying the usage of flash alert.
2. There's a mix of issues and merge requests.
3. Some todos have additional notes like "Could not merge" or "Due Mar 31, 2033".

This information helps paint a picture of the user's current tasks and their urgency.

Now, let's prepare our response:

1. We'll start with a summary of the total number of todos and their types.
2. Then, we'll list out the most recent todos (let's say the top 5) with their key details.
3. We'll highlight any todos that seem particularly important or urgent.

This approach should give the user a comprehensive view of their todos without overwhelming them with too much information. If they need more details, they can always ask for a more in-depth breakdown.

Let's proceed with crafting our response using the 'stop' action.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
The human has asked to check out their todos. We are currently on the To-Do List Dashboard page of GitLab, which displays all the necessary information.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The webpage shows a To-Do List Dashboard for GitLab. It displays a total of 20 active todos and 11 completed ones. The todos are a mix of issues and merge requests, each with details such as title, project (Byte Blaze), assignee, and time created. The most recent todo is from 2 days ago, concerning the clarification of flash alert usage. There are options to filter and sort the todos by various criteria like Group, Project, Author, Type, Action, and Last created.

REASON:
Given that we have all the necessary information to fulfill the user's request, and considering that a comprehensive overview of the todos would be most helpful, I will use the 'stop' action to provide a summary of the todos along with details of the most recent and potentially important items.

ACTION:
stop [Here's an overview of your todos:

Summary:
- Total active todos: 20
- Total completed todos: 11

Most recent and notable todos:

1. Clarify usage of flash alert
   Type: Issue #316
   Created: 2 days ago

2. Untitled todo
   Type: Issue #1539

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me carefully examine the information provided about this To-Do List Dashboard on GitLab...\n\nThe main elements I\'m seeing are:\n- A to-do list with 20 active items and 11 completed items\n- Options to filter and sort the to-dos \n- A list of individual to-do items with details like issue/merge request number, assignee, timestamp, etc.\n\nLooking at the trajectory of actions, it seems the user has:\n1. Navigated to the To-Do List Dashboard\n2. Viewed the list of active to-do items\n\nThe purpose appears to be checking on outstanding tasks and responsibilities within the GitLab project(s). \n\nSome key observations:\n- There\'s a mix of issues and merge requests in the to-do list\n- Items span from very recent (2 days ago) to quite old (1 year ago)\n- Many items are assigned to "You" (the user), but some involve other team members\n- There are options to mark individual items as done or mark all as done\n\nThis gives me a sense that the user is likely a developer or project manager reviewing their outstanding work items and deciding what to tackle next. The to-do list seems to function as a centralized task management tool within the GitLab workflow.\n\nI should emphasize the summary of active items and provide an overview of the types of tasks present, as that seems to be the core information the user is seeking by checking their to-dos.\n```\n\nBased on the information provided, here\'s a summary of the significant steps and the overall purpose of the actions:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. The user navigated to the To-Do List Dashboard in GitLab.\n2. They viewed the list of active to-do items, which currently shows 20 open tasks.\n\nPurpose of the trajectory:\nThe overall goal appears to be reviewing and managing outstanding tasks and responsibilities within the GitLab project(s). The user is likely checking their to-do list to get an overview of pending work items, prioritize tasks, and potentially take action on some of the listed items.\n\nKey points about the to-do list:\n- It contains a mix of issues and merge requests.\n- There are 20 active to-do items and 11 completed items.\n- The tasks range from very recent (2 days ago) to much older (1 year ago).\n- Many items are assigned to the user, but some involve other team members.\n- The list includes various types of tasks, such as implementing features, resolving issues, and reviewing merge requests.\n\nThis to-do list serves as a centralized task management tool within the GitLab workflow, allowing the user (likely a developer or project manager) to stay on top of their responsibilities and track the progress of various project-related tasks.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Check out my todos\n                Interaction History: \n

 External knowledge: [{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\nHere are the two summarizations as requested:\\n\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins on the GitLab dashboard page. The user first clicks on their profile name \\"Byte Blaze\\", which opens a dropdown menu. From this menu, they select the \\"Edit status\\" option, which opens a modal dialog for setting a status. The dialog already has the \\"Set yourself as busy\\" checkbox checked. Without making any changes to the status text or other options, the user immediately clicks the \\"Set status\\" button to confirm and apply the busy status. After this action, the modal closes and the user is returned to the dashboard page, with their status now set to busy. The trajectory efficiently accomplishes the goal of setting the GitLab status to \\"Busy\\" with minimal steps.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nSet your GitLab status to \\"Busy\\" from the dashboard page. Navigate to your profile settings by clicking on your profile name in the top navigation bar. In the dropdown menu, select the option to edit your status. When the status editing modal appears, ensure the \\"Set yourself as busy\\" option is checked. Without modifying any other settings or adding a custom status message, confirm and apply the busy status. This action should update your GitLab profile to show that you are currently busy, which may affect how others interact with you on the platform.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\nThe instruction and trajectory are well-aligned, as the trajectory successfully accomplishes the goal of setting the GitLab status to \\"Busy\\". The actions are coherent and follow a logical sequence based on the observations. The trajectory mimics natural user interactions one would expect when changing a status on a web platform. The solution used is reasonable and efficient, accomplishing the task with minimal necessary steps without overcomplication.

The initial observation shows various elements of the repository interface, including project information, navigation links, and file listings. The user then clicks on the \\"Settings\\" link in the sidebar, which is a logical action to take when seeking information about repository access.\\n\\nAfter clicking on the \\"Settings\\" link, the observation changes to show the General Settings page of the repository. This page includes options for updating project details such as name, description, and avatar. It also contains sections for managing visibility, project features, and permissions. The navigation sidebar now displays additional setting categories, including \\"Access Tokens\\" which might be relevant for managing repository access. However, the trajectory ends here without further actions to specifically locate user access information.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nNavigate to the settings page of the \\"solarized-prism-theme\\" repository on GitLab to investigate user access permissions. The user starts on the main repository page, which displays general project information and file listings. Recognizing that access information is typically found in project settings, the user clicks on the \\"Settings\\" link in the sidebar navigation. This action takes them to the General Settings page, which offers various configuration options for the repository. Although the trajectory doesn\'t show further navigation to a specific access control section, it positions the user in the correct area of the GitLab interface to begin exploring user permissions and access settings for the repository.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction by navigating to the settings page, which is a logical step towards finding user access information.\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logically connected, moving from the main repository page to the settings page.\\n3. Natural: The trajectory mimics a natural user interaction, clicking on relevant links to navigate the interface.\\n4.

The user is presented with a comprehensive view of their projects, including project names, visibility status, and recent activity. The interface also displays links to issues, merge requests, and a to-do list.\\n\\nAfter this initial observation, the action taken is to stop, as there is no clear path to set the GitLab status as \\"Busy\\". The reason provided is that the current view does not offer any direct access to user profile or settings where such a status change option would typically be found. The user notes that the closest potential interaction point for accessing user settings might be a user avatar or name, often located in the top right corner of such interfaces, but this is not visible in the current observation.\\n\\nThe trajectory then shows a second identical observation of the GitLab dashboard, followed by another stop action. The reasoning remains the same - there is no visible option to set the user status to \\"Busy\\" within the current view, and no clear path to navigate to a page where such an option might be available.\\n\\nThroughout the trajectory, no changes are made to the interface or user status, as the required action cannot be completed based on the available information and interface elements.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to attempt to set the user\'s GitLab status as \\"Busy\\". The task involves navigating the GitLab dashboard interface to locate and access user profile settings where status options are typically found. The user is expected to search for a menu, button, or link that would lead to personal settings or a status change feature.\\n\\nHowever, the trajectory reveals that the current view of the GitLab dashboard does not provide a clear path to accomplish this task. The user carefully examines the interface, looking for any elements that might lead to user settings or profile options, such as a user avatar or name typically located in the top right corner of web applications.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates the user\'s thorough inspection of the available options and interface elements, including project lists, navigation menus, and various links to GitLab features like issues and merge requests. Despite this comprehensive examination, the user is unable to find a direct way to change their status to \\"Busy\\".\\n\\nThe purpose also includes the decision-making process of determining when to stop attempting the task due to the lack of necessary interface elements or navigation options. This showcases the user\'s ability to assess the situation and conclude that the current view does not allow for the completion of the intended task, highlighting the importance of clear user interface design for accessibility of common features like status changes.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, the evaluation of the trajectory and instruction is as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction as it attempts to set the GitLab status as \\"Busy\\", but is unable to complete the task due to limitations in the interface.\\n\\n2. Coherence: The trajectory is coherent, with each action (stopping) being logical based on the previous observation.\\n\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics real-world interactions, as a human user would likely inspect the interface and stop when unable to find the necessary options.\\n\\n4. Reasonableness: The trajectory uses a reasonable approach by thoroughly examining the available options before concluding that the task cannot be completed with the current interface.\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Set my gitlab status as Busy.\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-github.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\\\\n\\\\n[3852] RootWebArea \'Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[3862] link \'Skip to content\'\\\\n\\\\t[3919] link \'Dashboard\'\\\\n\\\\t[5481] button \'\' hasPopup: menu expanded: True\\\\n\\\\t[5589] list \'\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5628] StaticText \'Switch to\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5606] button \'Projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5579] button \'Groups\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5617] StaticText \'Explore\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5613] link \'Milestones\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5623] link \'Snippets\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5595] link \'Activity\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5643] searchbox \'Search your projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5612] StaticText \'Frequently visited\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5618] StaticText \'Projects you visit often will appear here\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5637] link \'View all projects\'\\\\n\\\\t[5372] textbox \'Search GitLab\' required: False\\\\n\\\\t[5333] generic \'Use the shortcut key <kbd>/</kbd> to start a search\'\\\\n\\\\t[4039] link \'Create new...\'\\\\n\\\\t[4041] link \'Issues\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4910] generic \'14 assigned issues\'\\\\n\\\\t[4042] link \'Merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4912] generic \'8 merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t[4044] link \'To-Do List\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4928] generic \'Todos count\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5354] StaticText \'5\'\\\\n\\\\t[4045] link \'Help\'\\\\n\\\\t[4047] link \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4962] img \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t[3868] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3882] heading \'Projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3885] link \'New project\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4049] link \'Yours 17\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4050] link \'Starred 3\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4051] link \'Explore\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4052] link \'Topics\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3892] searchbox \'Filter by name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3975] button \'Name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4096] link \'All\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4097] link \'Personal\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4098] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4103] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4106] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4104] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4112] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5022] generic \'lipstick\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5364] StaticText \'\\ud83d\\udc84\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5023] StaticText \' Accessible light and dark syntax highlighting themes\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4129] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4130] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4131] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4132] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4142] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4143] time \'Mar 23, 2024 11:03pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4144] StaticText \'10 hours ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4145] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4150] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4153] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4151] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4159] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5041] generic \'globe with meridians\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5365] StaticText \'\\ud83c\\udf10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5042] StaticText \' A webring for digital accessibility practitioners.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4176] link \'2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4177] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4178] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4179] link \'4\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4189] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4190] time \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4191] StaticText \'11 months ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4192] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4197] heading \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4200] link \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4198] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4206] StaticText \'Maintainer\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5060] StaticText \'The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4223] link \'21\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4224] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4225] link \'10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4226] link \'41\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4236] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4237] time \'Mar 24, 2024 9:31am EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4238] StaticText \'3 minutes ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4239] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4244] heading \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4247] link \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4245] generic \'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

However, the observation does not mention any direct link or button related to user settings or profile where the status could be set. The closest interaction that might lead to user settings or profile is the user\'s name or avatar, usually located at the top right corner of the page in web applications like GitLab. Since the observation does not provide a specific ID for the user\'s profile or settings, we cannot proceed with a direct action to set the status. Therefore, the next logical step is to stop and report that the task cannot be completed based on the current observation.\\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}"}, {"External Knowledge3": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins with the user on the GitLab dashboard, showing a list of projects and various navigation options. The initial observation reveals a complex interface with multiple links, buttons, and project information. The user\'s first action is to click on a button (id 5481) that appears to be a dropdown menu, possibly related to user settings or profile options.\\n\\nAfter clicking the button, the observation shows that the dropdown menu has expanded, revealing additional options. The expanded menu includes switches for \\"Projects\\" and \\"Groups\\", as well as links to \\"Milestones\\", \\"Snippets\\", and \\"Activity\\". There\'s also a search box for projects and a section for frequently visited projects. However, there are no explicit options for setting the user status to \\"Busy\\" visible in this expanded menu.\\n\\nThe trajectory demonstrates the user\'s attempt to find the option to set their status, but it doesn\'t show the successful completion of this task within the given steps. The actions taken are logical and align with a typical user\'s approach to finding profile or status settings in a web application.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory appears to be navigating the GitLab interface to locate user profile settings or status options. The user is attempting to find a way to set their GitLab status as \\"Busy\\". The trajectory shows the initial exploration of the GitLab dashboard, followed by an attempt to access additional options through what seems to be a user profile dropdown menu.\\n\\nThe user\'s actions reflect a common approach to finding such settings in web applications: first scanning the main interface for relevant options, then clicking on user-related menus or dropdowns when the desired option isn\'t immediately visible. This process of exploration and navigation is typical when users are trying to locate specific settings or features within a complex web application.\\n\\nWhile the trajectory doesn\'t show the successful completion of setting the status to \\"Busy\\", it demonstrates the initial steps a user would likely take in attempting to find this option. The actions are consistent with the goal of locating user-specific settings or options within the GitLab interface, even though the exact path to the status setting is not revealed in the given steps.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, I would evaluate this trajectory and instruction pair as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction to some extent, as it shows attempts to find user settings, but it doesn\'t actually accomplish setting the status to \\"Busy\\".\\n2. Coherence: The actions are logical and don\'t contradict each other, following a natural progression of exploration.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics real-world interactions a user might take when trying to find a specific setting in a web application.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach taken is reasonable, starting with exploring the main interface and then accessing a dropdown menu that might contain user-related options.\\n\\nWhile the trajectory doesn\'t complete the task, it represents a logical and natural start to the process. Therefore, considering the partial alignment and the naturalness of the actions, I would say:\\n\\n**yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Set my gitlab status as Busy.\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-github.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\\\\n\\\\n[3852] RootWebArea \'Projects \\u00b7 Dashboard \\u00b7 GitLab\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[3862] link \'Skip to content\'\\\\n\\\\t[3919] link \'Dashboard\'\\\\n\\\\t[5481] button \'\' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t[5372] textbox \'Search GitLab\' required: False\\\\n\\\\t[5333] generic \'Use the shortcut key <kbd>/</kbd> to start a search\'\\\\n\\\\t[4039] link \'Create new...\'\\\\n\\\\t[4041] link \'Issues\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4910] generic \'14 assigned issues\'\\\\n\\\\t[4042] link \'Merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4912] generic \'8 merge requests\'\\\\n\\\\t[4044] link \'To-Do List\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4928] generic \'Todos count\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5354] StaticText \'5\'\\\\n\\\\t[4045] link \'Help\'\\\\n\\\\t[4047] link \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4962] img \'Byte Blaze\'\\\\n\\\\t[3868] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3882] heading \'Projects\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3885] link \'New project\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4049] link \'Yours 17\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4050] link \'Starred 3\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4051] link \'Explore\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4052] link \'Topics\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3892] searchbox \'Filter by name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[3975] button \'Name\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4096] link \'All\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4097] link \'Personal\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4098] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4103] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4106] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4104] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4112] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5022] generic \'lipstick\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5364] StaticText \'\\ud83d\\udc84\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5023] StaticText \' Accessible light and dark syntax highlighting themes\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4129] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4130] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4131] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4132] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4142] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4143] time \'Mar 23, 2024 11:03pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4144] StaticText \'10 hours ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4145] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4150] heading \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4153] link \'Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4151] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4159] StaticText \'Owner\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5041] generic \'globe with meridians\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[5365] StaticText \'\\ud83c\\udf10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5042] StaticText \' A webring for digital accessibility practitioners.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4176] link \'2\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4177] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4178] link \'1\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4179] link \'4\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4189] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4190] time \'Mar 27, 2023 7:22pm EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4191] StaticText \'11 months ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4192] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4197] heading \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4200] link \'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4198] generic \'Public - The project can be accessed without any authentication.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4206] StaticText \'Maintainer\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[5060] StaticText \'The A11Y Project is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4223] link \'21\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4224] link \'0\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4225] link \'10\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4226] link \'41\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4236] StaticText \'Updated \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4237] time \'Mar 24, 2024 9:31am EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4238] StaticText \'3 minutes ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4239] link \'A\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4244] heading \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[4247] link \'Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[4245] generic \'Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.

The observation mentions a user \\\\\\"Byte Blaze\\\\\\" which seems to be the profile name. However, there\'s no direct link or button mentioned for accessing user settings or status update options. Given the structure of GitLab\'s UI, such options are often found in a dropdown menu associated with the user\'s profile picture or name. The closest element that could potentially lead to such options based on the provided observation is the button with an unspecified name (id 5481), which might be the user profile or settings dropdown menu.

Please Evaluate whether the provided External knowledges can help another gpt model to predict a action, based on the current system message, Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations. If any External knowledges are useful, identify which ones have value and explain why they are useful. Finally, output the useful External knowledges in the format [External knowledge0, External knowledge1].'}], 'filter output': '```thinking\nLet me analyze each piece of external knowledge to determine if it can help predict the next action:\n\nExternal Knowledge0:\nThis describes a trajectory for setting GitLab status to "Busy". It shows steps like clicking on the user profile, selecting "Edit status", and confirming the busy status. This is directly relevant to the current goal and provides a clear path to accomplish it. It would be very useful for predicting the next action.\n\nExternal Knowledge1: \nThis knowledge is about navigating to repository settings to find user access information. While it demonstrates navigation within GitLab, it\'s not directly relevant to setting user status. It\'s unlikely to be helpful for the current task.\n\nExternal Knowledge2:\nThis describes attempts to set GitLab status as "Busy" but ultimately fails to find the option. While it shows some exploration of the interface, it doesn\'t provide a successful path to accomplish the goal. It\'s not particularly useful for predicting the next action.\n\nExternal Knowledge3:\nThis shows navigation attempts to find user profile settings or status options, including expanding a dropdown menu. While it doesn\'t complete the task, it does provide some relevant information about where to look for user-related options. It could be somewhat useful in combination with more specific information.\n\nBased on this analysis, External Knowledge0 is clearly the most useful, as it provides a direct path to accomplish the goal. External Knowledge3 has some limited utility in describing where to look for user options. The others are not particularly relevant to the current task.\n\nTherefore, the useful external knowledge to output would be:\n[External Knowledge0, External Knowledge3]\n```\n\nThe useful External knowledges are [External Knowledge0, External Knowledge3]. External Knowledge0 provides a clear and direct path for setting the GitLab status to "Busy", which directly aligns with the current goal. External Knowledge3, while not providing a complete solution, offers some relevant information about navigating to user-related options in the GitLab interface, which could be helpful in combination with the more specific instructions from External Knowledge0.'}
