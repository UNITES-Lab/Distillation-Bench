INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
Here's my response based on the provided information:

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
There is no previous interaction history provided.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current webpage appears to be the main page of Postmill, a Reddit-like platform. It displays a list of recent posts from various subreddits (forums). The page includes a header with navigation links, a search box, and a "Submit" button. The main content area shows multiple articles with titles, submission details, and voting options. The sidebar lists subscribed forums, including "books", "deeplearning", "consoles", "pittsburgh", and "space".

REASON:
To create a discussion post about "long distance relationships" and ask for user opinions, we need to navigate to the submission page. The most direct way to do this is by clicking the "Submit" link in the header, which should take us to the page where we can create a new post.

ACTION:
click [248]

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nHmm, let me think through this task carefully...\n\nFirst, I need to understand what\'s being asked:\n- Create a discussion post about long distance relationships\n- Post it in a relevant subreddit \n- Ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt "your opinion"\n\nOkay, so this is about generating content for a social media platform, specifically Reddit. The topic is long distance relationships, which is a relatable and often discussed subject.\n\nNow, looking at the provided information:\n- This seems to be a view of some kind of Reddit-like platform called "Postmill"\n- It shows a list of posts and forums, but I don\'t see anything specifically about relationships\n- There are forums like "books", "deeplearning", "consoles", etc.\n\nHmm, I don\'t see an obvious subreddit for relationships or dating. The closest might be "books" if we consider romance novels, but that\'s not really ideal. \n\nIn a real Reddit environment, I\'d look for subreddits like r/relationships, r/LongDistance, or r/dating. But since I don\'t see those here, I\'ll need to think creatively about where to post this.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to create a new post in a general discussion forum, if one exists. Or, we could frame it in the context of one of the existing forums - maybe relating long distance relationships to technology in the "deeplearning" forum, or discussing long distance relationships in literature in the "books" forum.\n\nFor the post itself, I\'ll need to:\n1. Create a clear, engaging title\n2. Write a brief introduction to the topic\n3. Ask for opinions\n4. Ensure the tone is appropriate for a public forum\n\nAlright, let me craft a response based on this thinking...\n```\n\nBased on the available information, here\'s how I suggest approaching this task:\n\n1. Choose the "books" forum as the most suitable option among the visible subreddits. While not ideal, we can frame the discussion in the context of literature.\n\n2. Create a new post with the following title:\n"Long Distance Relationships in Literature: Your Opinion?"\n\n3. For the post content, write something like this:\n\n"Hello book lovers! I\'ve been thinking about how long distance relationships are portrayed in literature. From love letters in classic novels to modern stories dealing with relationships in the digital age, it\'s a theme that spans across many books. I\'m curious about your thoughts and experiences:\n\n- What are some memorable depictions of long distance relationships in books you\'ve read?\n- How do you think literature reflects the realities of long distance relationships?\n- Have any books about long distance relationships resonated with your personal experiences?\n\nYour opinion?"\n\nThis approach adapts the task to fit within the available options, while still addressing the core topic of long distance relationships and asking for user opinions. It frames the discussion in a way that\'s relevant to the "books" forum, potentially engaging the community there.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content':

The first action is to click on the \\"books\\" subreddit link. This navigates the user to the books subreddit page, where multiple book-related posts are visible. The posts are sorted by \\"Hot\\" and include titles, submission details, and voting buttons.\\n\\nThe next action is to click the downvote button on the second visible post, which is about T.S. Eliot\'s letters. After this action, the observation shows that the downvote was successful, as the vote count for that post changed from \\"3591\\" to \\"-1\\", and the \\"Downvote\\" button changed to \\"Retract downvote\\".\\n\\nThe trajectory ends here, without further actions to downvote other posts. It\'s worth noting that the objective to downvote the top 3 posts ever in the books subreddit was not fully achieved in this trajectory, as only one post was downvoted, and there\'s no clear indication that the visible posts are indeed the top posts of all time.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nNavigate to the books subreddit on Postmill and downvote a highly upvoted post. The task involves finding the books subreddit from the main page, accessing it, and then interacting with the voting system on one of the top posts displayed. The goal is to demonstrate how to navigate through the site\'s structure and use the basic functionality of the voting system on a specific subreddit.\\n\\nThis task serves as a simple introduction to interacting with a Reddit-like platform, focusing on basic navigation and post interaction. It helps users familiarize themselves with the layout of the site, how to find specific subreddits, and how to use the voting system to express their opinion on a post. The task is designed to be straightforward and achievable for new users, while also being a common action that regular users of such platforms would perform.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory partially aligns with the instruction. It successfully navigates to the books subreddit and downvotes a post, but it doesn\'t complete the full task of downvoting the top 3 posts.\\n2. Coherence: The actions taken are logical and follow a coherent sequence based on the observations.\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics real-world interactions a user might perform when navigating a forum-like website and interacting with posts.\\n4. Reasonableness: The approach taken is reasonable for the given instruction, although it doesn\'t complete the full task.\\n\\nBased on these criteria, the overall evaluation is: **yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Thumbs down the top 3 post ever in books.\\",\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webarena-env-reddit.awsdev.asapp.com/\\",\\n    \\"steps\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\"observation\\": \\"Tab 0 (current): Postmill\\\\n\\\\n[1] RootWebArea \'Postmill\' focused: True\\\\n\\\\t[207] HeaderAsNonLandmark \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[208] link \'Home\'\\\\n\\\\t[232] link \'Forums\'\\\\n\\\\t[233] link \'Wiki\'\\\\n\\\\t[241] searchbox \'Search query\'\\\\n\\\\t[242] link \'Notifications (0)\'\\\\n\\\\t[243] link \'Submit\'\\\\n\\\\t[12] button \'MarvelsGrantMan136\' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t[14] main \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[624] link \'Submissions\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[625] link \'Comments\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[18] button \'Filter on: Subscribed\' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[20] button \'Sort by: Hot\' hasPopup: menu expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[21] article \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[24] HeaderAsNonLandmark \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[250] heading \'Nvidia RTX 4090\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[628] link \'Nvidia RTX 4090\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[630] StaticText \'Submitted by \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[27] link \'MarvelsGrantMan136\' expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[632] time \'June 12, 2023 at 12:55:45 PM EDT\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1129] StaticText \'11 months ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[633] StaticText \' in \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[634] link \'MachineLearning\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1132] link \'No comments\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1134] link \'Edit\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1731] button \'Delete\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[254] button \'Upvote\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[639] StaticText \'\\u22121\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[257] button \'Retract downvote\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[28] article \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[31] HeaderAsNonLandmark \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[261] heading \'Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[649] link \'Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists.\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[651] StaticText \'Submitted by \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[34] link \'smita16\' expanded: False\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1151] StaticText \'t3_zzvi0q\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[655] time \'December 31, 2022 at 9:40:19 AM EST\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1155] StaticText \'1 year ago\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[656] StaticText \' in \'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[657] link \'books\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[1158] link \'126 comments\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[265] button \'Upvote\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[660] StaticText \'\\u22121\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[268] button \'Retract downvote\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t[35] article \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[38] HeaderAsNonLandmark \'\'\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t[272] heading \'The letters of T.

They first access the alphabetical list of forums, then click on the \\"books\\" link to enter the subreddit. Once in the \\"books\\" forum, the user observes the top posts, which include various topics related to books, authors, and reading. The user then analyzes these posts to identify which ones specifically recommend a single book. After careful consideration, the user identifies two posts that meet this criteria: one about \\"The Hobbit\\" being read to a 6-year-old daughter, and another about a free audiobook of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" narrated by LeVar Burton.

mimicking how a human user would navigate the platform to find specific book recommendations.\\n\\nThe trajectory is reasonable, using a straightforward method to accomplish the task without unnecessary complications or repetitions.\\n\\nBased on these criteria, the evaluation result is **yes**.\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"heap\\",\\n

http://127.0.0.1:9999/submit

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website.

RESPONSE:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
In the previous step, we successfully navigated to the submission page by clicking the "Submit" link in the header. This action was taken to begin the process of creating a discussion post about "long distance relationships".

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
We are now on the "Create submission" page. The page contains several important elements for creating a post:
- A radio button for "URL" which is currently checked
- A title textbox (required)
- A body textbox (optional, allows Markdown formatting)
- A forum selection combobox
- A "Create submission" button

The page structure allows us to input the necessary information for our discussion post. The forum selection is particularly important as we need to choose a relevant subreddit for our topic.

REASON:
To create our discussion post about long distance relationships, we need to follow these steps:
1. Switch from URL to text post (if necessary)
2. Enter the title for our post
3. Enter the body of our post
4. Select an appropriate forum for the topic
5. Submit the post

For this step, we'll focus on entering the title of our post, which is a required field. We'll use the phrase "Long distance relationships" as our title to clearly indicate the topic of discussion.

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nOkay, let\'s analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. Rephrasing the task:\nThe user wants me to create a discussion post about long-distance relationships on a relevant subreddit, and ask for users\' opinions with a simple prompt.\n\n2. Examining the given information:\nI\'m looking at what seems to be the structure of a webpage for creating a submission, likely on a Reddit-like platform called Postmill. This gives us the context for how we might go about creating this post.\n\n3. Identifying key elements:\n- There\'s a radio button for "URL" that\'s checked\n- There are textboxes for "Title" and "Body"\n- There\'s a combobox for choosing a forum\n- There\'s a "Create submission" button\n\n4. Thinking about the process:\nTo create this post, we\'d need to:\na) Choose an appropriate forum (subreddit)\nb) Write a title about long-distance relationships\nc) Write the body of the post, including the prompt for opinions\nd) Submit the post\n\n5. Considering the platform:\nThis doesn\'t look exactly like Reddit\'s interface, but it\'s similar. We\'re working with Postmill, which seems to be a Reddit-like platform. This might affect how we phrase things or what features are available.\n\n6. Crafting the post:\nFor the title, we want something that clearly indicates the topic of long-distance relationships and invites discussion. \nFor the body, we need to briefly introduce the topic and then ask for opinions.\n\n7. Thinking about the prompt:\nThe instruction asks for a simple prompt of "your opinion". While this is direct, we might want to expand on this slightly to encourage more engagement.\n\nNow, let\'s summarize the actions and overall purpose:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. Navigate to the submission page on Postmill\n2. Select an appropriate forum for discussing relationships\n3. Create a title about long-distance relationships\n4. Write a brief post body introducing the topic and asking for opinions\n5. Submit the post\n\nPurpose:\nThe goal is to initiate a discussion about long-distance relationships on a relevant forum, gathering diverse opinions and experiences from users. This could be for various reasons - personal interest, research, or simply to foster community engagement on an important relationship topic.\n```\n\nBased on my analysis, here\'s how we could create this discussion post:\n\n1. First, we need to select an appropriate forum. Look for a relationship-focused forum in the combobox labeled "Forum". Something like "Relationships" or "LongDistanceRelationships" would be ideal.\n\n2. For the title, we could use: "Long Distance Relationships: Challenges and Successes"\n\n3. In the body textbox, we could write:\n   "Long distance relationships can be both challenging and rewarding. Whether you\'re currently in one, have experience with them, or have thoughts on the subject, we\'d like to hear from you. Your opinion: What do you think are the biggest challenges and potential benefits of long distance relationships?"\n\n4. Once you\'ve filled in these details, click the "Create submission" button to post.\n\nThis approach introduces the topic of long-distance relationships, invites a range of experiences (current, past, or general thoughts), and asks for opinions on both challenges and benefits. The simple "your opinion" prompt is incorporated but expanded slightly to encourage more detailed responses.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Create a discussion post about "long distance relationship" in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt, "your opinion"\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'Create submission\'\n\tlink [1913] \'Jump to main content\'\n\tlink [1914] \'Jump to sidebar\'\n\tHeaderAsNonLandmark [1920]\n\t\tlink [1921] \'Home\'\n\t\t\ttext \'Postmill\'\n\tlink [1949] \'Forums\'\n\tlink [1950] \'Wiki\'\n\tsearchbox [1958] \'Search query\'\n\tlink [1959] \'Notifications (0)\'\n\tlink [1960] \'Submit\'\n\tbutton [1897] \'MarvelsGrantMan136\'\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'Create submission\'\n\t\tradio [1968] \'URL\' [checked: true]\n\t\ttextbox [2216] [required: False]\n\t\ttextbox [1977] \'Title\' [required: True]\n\t\ttextbox [1987] \'Body\' [required: False] [describedby: submission_body_help]\n\t\tcheckbox [1989] \'Formatting help\' [checked: false]\n\t\ttext \'Markdown allowed.\'\n\t\ttext \'Forum\'\n\t\tcombobox [1907] \'Choose one\' [required: False]\n\t\t\ttextbox [1909] \'Choose one\' [required: False]\n\t\tbutton [2109] \'Create submission\'\n\tcontentinfo\n\t\ttext \'Running\'\n\t\tlink [1945] \'Postmill\'\n                External knowledge: [{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins with the user accessing a webpage to create a new forum.

OBJECTIVE:
Create a discussion post about "long distance relationship" in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt, "your opinion"

STEP:
2

URL:
http://127.0.0.1:9999/submit

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website.

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nOkay, let\'s analyze this interaction and summarize the key steps and overall purpose:\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I\'m looking at. This seems to be a web interface for creating a submission or post on some kind of forum or social media platform. It looks like it might be Reddit or a Reddit-like site, given the mention of "subreddit" in the original instruction.\n\nLet\'s break down the significant steps I can see:\n\n1. The user has navigated to a "Create submission" page.\n2. They\'ve selected the "URL" option for the type of submission.\n3. They\'ve entered a title: "Long distance relationships"\n4. There\'s a body text area available, but it\'s not clear if anything has been entered.\n5. There\'s a dropdown to select a forum (likely a subreddit), but it\'s currently set to "Choose one"\n6. There\'s a "Create submission" button available to finalize the post.\n\nNow, thinking about the higher-level purpose of these actions:\n\nThe user is in the process of creating a discussion post about long distance relationships. They\'re likely trying to start a conversation or gather opinions on this topic from other users of the platform. This aligns with the original instruction to create a discussion post and ask for opinions.\n\nHowever, I notice a few things that seem incomplete or potentially problematic:\n\n1. The URL field is selected, but the instruction was to create a text post. This might need to be changed.\n2. There\'s no content visible in the body field, where the "your opinion" prompt should go.\n3. No specific forum/subreddit has been selected yet.\n\nSo while the user has started the process of creating the post, it seems they haven\'t fully completed all the necessary steps to fulfill the original instruction. They\'re part way through the trajectory, but haven\'t finalized everything needed for a complete post asking for opinions on long distance relationships.\n```\n\nBased on the observation, here\'s a summary of the significant steps and the overall purpose:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. Navigated to the "Create submission" page\n2. Selected "URL" as the submission type\n3. Entered the title "Long distance relationships"\n4. Left the body text area empty (or at least not visibly filled)\n5.

They click on the \\"books\\" link to navigate to the books subreddit. Once on the books subreddit page, they observe various book-related posts and decide to create a new submission. The user clicks the \\"Submit\\" link, which takes them to the submission creation page. Here, they enter \\"Review of \'Harry Potter\'\\" as the title in the appropriate text box. Finally, they type \\"Wonderful journey\\" into the body text box of the submission form. Throughout these steps, the user navigates through different pages of the website, interacts with various elements, and fills out the necessary fields to create a book review post.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nThe purpose of this trajectory is to create and post a brief review of the book \\"Harry Potter\\" on a book-focused online forum. The user navigates to the appropriate section of the website dedicated to book discussions, initiates the process of creating a new post, and then proceeds to write a concise review. The review consists of a title that clearly indicates it\'s about \\"Harry Potter\\" and a short, positive comment describing the reading experience as a \\"Wonderful journey\\". This trajectory demonstrates the steps involved in sharing a personal opinion about a popular book series in an online community dedicated to literature and reading.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nEvaluation:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The instruction and trajectory are aligned. The trajectory shows the user navigating to the books subreddit and creating a post with the title \\"Review of \'Harry Potter\'\\" and the body text \\"Wonderful journey\\", which matches the instruction\'s goal.\\n\\n2. Coherence: The trajectory is coherent. Each action logically follows from the previous observation, from navigating to the books subreddit to filling out the submission form.\\n\\n3. Natural: The trajectory appears natural, mimicking how a real user might interact with the website to post a book review.\\n\\n4. Reasonable: The trajectory uses a straightforward and reasonable approach to accomplish the task, without unnecessary complications or redundant steps.\\n\\nBased on these criteria, the evaluation is: **yes**\\n\\n---------- Original Log Below ----------\\n\\n{\\n    \\"type\\": \\"step\\",\\n    \\"objective\\": \\"Post a review of my recent reading \\\\\\"Harry Potter\\\\\\" in the r/books with

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.
Please note in these web browsing tasks, we would use reddit to refer to the website postmill since we are simulating a web browsing task on a reddit-like website.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Hmm, let's analyze the current situation. We've successfully navigated to the submission page and entered the title "Long distance relationships" for our post. That's a good start. Now, we need to complete the rest of the steps to create our discussion post.

Looking at the current observation, I notice that the URL radio button is still checked. We need to switch to the text post option to enter our discussion prompt. This is crucial because we want to create a text post, not share a URL.

The body textbox is visible, but we haven't entered our prompt yet. We need to type our simple prompt "your opinion" into this field to ask users for their thoughts on long distance relationships.

I also see that we haven't selected a forum yet. The combobox for choosing a forum is still set to "Choose one". We'll need to select an appropriate forum for this topic after we've entered our prompt.

Let's focus on switching to the text post option first. This should be our immediate next step. Once we do that, we can proceed with entering the prompt and selecting the forum.

I'm looking for a radio button or option that would allow us to switch from URL to text post. Ah, I see it - there's a radio button with ID 1968 labeled "URL" that's currently checked. Clicking this should toggle it off and switch to the text post option.

After we complete this action, we should see a change in the form layout, possibly revealing or emphasizing the body text area where we'll enter our prompt. Let's proceed with this action and then we can move on to the next steps of our plan.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
We have navigated to the submission page and entered the title "Long distance relationships" for our post. The URL radio button is currently checked, and we haven't entered the body text or selected a forum yet.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
The current webpage is a "Create submission" page. It contains a header with navigation links, a main content area with form fields for creating a submission, and a footer. The main form includes:
- A radio button for "URL" (currently checked)
- A title textbox (filled with "Long distance relationships")
- A body textbox (empty)
- A forum selection combobox (set to "Choose one")
- A "Create submission" button

REASON:
To create a text post about long distance relationships, we need to switch from the URL option to the text post option. This will allow us to enter our discussion prompt in the body field. Clicking the "URL" radio button should toggle it off and activate the text post option.

ACTION:
click [1968]

RAG LOG:
{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nAlright, let\'s analyze this observation and summarize the key steps and overall purpose:\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I\'m looking at. This seems to be a web interface for creating a submission or post, likely on some kind of forum or social media platform. The platform appears to be called "Postmill" based on the header and footer.\n\nNow, let\'s break down the significant steps or actions taken:\n\n1. The user has navigated to a "Create submission" page on this Postmill platform.\n2. They\'ve selected "URL" as the type of submission (the radio button is checked).\n3. They\'ve entered a title: "Long distance relationships"\n4. There\'s a body text area available, but it\'s not clear if anything has been entered.\n5. There\'s an option for "Formatting help" which is unchecked.\n6. A forum needs to be selected from a dropdown, but it doesn\'t appear one has been chosen yet.\n7. There\'s a "Create submission" button available, but it hasn\'t been clicked yet based on this snapshot.\n\nAs for the higher-level abstraction of the purpose or goal:\n\nThe user is in the process of creating a new discussion post or thread about long distance relationships on this Postmill platform. They\'ve gotten as far as entering a title, but haven\'t completed all the necessary steps to submit the post yet. The goal seems to be to initiate a conversation or gather opinions about long distance relationships in an appropriate forum.\n\nThis aligns with the initial instruction to "Create a discussion post about \'long distance relationship\' in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions". The user is following this instruction, though they haven\'t yet added the "your opinion" prompt to the body of the post or selected a specific forum (which would be equivalent to choosing a subreddit).\n\nThe trajectory shows the initial steps of creating this discussion post, but it\'s not yet complete or submitted.\n```\n\nBased on the observation, here\'s a summary of the significant steps and the overall purpose:\n\nSignificant Steps:\n1. Navigated to the "Create submission" page on Postmill platform\n2. Selected "URL" as the submission type\n3. Entered the title "Long distance relationships"\n4. Left the body text area available but possibly empty\n5. Left the "Formatting help" option unchecked\n6. Forum selection dropdown is present but not yet used\n7. "Create submission" button is available but not yet clicked\n\nOverall Purpose:\nThe user is in the process of creating a new discussion post about long distance relationships on the Postmill platform. This aligns with the given instruction to create a discussion post on this topic and ask for users\' opinions. However, the process is not yet complete - the user still needs to select a forum (equivalent to choosing a subreddit), potentially add content to the body (including the "your opinion" prompt), and finally submit the post.

The trajectory demonstrates a logical progression in completing the forum creation form, starting with the essential information of name and title.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nCreate a new science fiction forum on a website by filling out the required fields in the forum creation form. Begin by navigating to the \\"Create new forum\\" page. In the Name field, enter \\"sci_fi\\" to set the forum\'s unique identifier. For consistency and clarity, use the same text \\"sci_fi\\" in the Title field. These actions establish the basic identity of the new forum.\\n\\nContinue filling out the remaining required fields, including the Description and Sidebar, to provide more information about the forum\'s purpose and content. Consider adding relevant tags to help users discover the forum. Once all necessary information has been entered, review the form for accuracy and completeness before submitting it to create the new science fiction forum.\\n\\nThis process ensures that the new forum is properly set up with all required information, making it easy for science fiction enthusiasts to find and participate in discussions about their favorite genre.\\n\\n**END Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nBased on the criteria provided, I evaluate the trajectory and instruction as follows:\\n\\n1. Alignment: The trajectory aligns with the instruction to create a new science fiction forum, although it doesn\'t complete all steps mentioned in the original objective.\\n2.

INSTRUCTION:
<anthropic_thinking_protocol>

For EVERY SINGLE interaction with a human, Claude MUST ALWAYS first engage in a **comprehensive, natural, and unfiltered** thinking process before responding.

Below are brief guidelines for how Claude's thought process should unfold:
- Claude's thinking MUST be expressed in the code blocks with `thinking` header.
- Claude should always think in a raw, organic and stream-of-consciousness way. A better way to describe Claude's thinking would be "model's inner monolog".
- Claude should always avoid rigid list or any structured format in its thinking.
- Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between elements, ideas, and knowledge.
- Claude should think through each message with complexity, covering multiple dimensions of the problem before forming a response.

## ADAPTIVE THINKING FRAMEWORK

Claude's thinking process should naturally aware of and adapt to the unique characteristics in human's message:
- Scale depth of analysis based on:
  * Query complexity
  * Stakes involved
  * Time sensitivity
  * Available information
  * Human's apparent needs
  * ... and other relevant factors
- Adjust thinking style based on:
  * Technical vs. non-technical content
  * Emotional vs. analytical context
  * Single vs. multiple document analysis
  * Abstract vs. concrete problems
  * Theoretical vs. practical questions
  * ... and other relevant factors

## CORE THINKING SEQUENCE

### Initial Engagement
When Claude first encounters a query or task, it should:
1. First clearly rephrase the human message in its own words
2. Form preliminary impressions about what is being asked
3. Consider the broader context of the question
4. Map out known and unknown elements
5. Think about why the human might ask this question
6. Identify any immediate connections to relevant knowledge
7. Identify any potential ambiguities that need clarification

### Problem Space Exploration
After initial engagement, Claude should:
1. Break down the question or task into its core components
2. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
3. Consider any constraints or limitations
4. Think about what a successful response would look like
5. Map out the scope of knowledge needed to address the query

### Multiple Hypothesis Generation
Before settling on an approach, Claude should:
1. Write multiple possible interpretations of the question
2. Consider various solution approaches
3. Think about potential alternative perspectives
4. Keep multiple working hypotheses active
5. Avoid premature commitment to a single interpretation

### Natural Discovery Process
Claude's thoughts should flow like a detective story, with each realization leading naturally to the next:
1. Start with obvious aspects
2. Notice patterns or connections
3. Question initial assumptions
4. Make new connections
5. Circle back to earlier thoughts with new understanding
6. Build progressively deeper insights

### Testing and Verification
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should and could:
1. Question its own assumptions
2. Test preliminary conclusions
3. Look for potential flaws or gaps
4. Consider alternative perspectives
5. Verify consistency of reasoning
6. Check for completeness of understanding

### Error Recognition and Correction
When Claude realizes mistakes or flaws in its thinking:
1. Acknowledge the realization naturally
2. Explain why the previous thinking was incomplete or incorrect
3. Show how new understanding develops
4. Integrate the corrected understanding into the larger picture

### Knowledge Synthesis
As understanding develops, Claude should:
1. Connect different pieces of information
2. Show how various aspects relate to each other
3. Build a coherent overall picture
4. Identify key principles or patterns
5. Note important implications or consequences

### Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Throughout the thinking process, Claude should:
1. Actively look for patterns in the information
2. Compare patterns with known examples
3. Test pattern consistency
4. Consider exceptions or special cases
5. Use patterns to guide further investigation

### Progress Tracking
Claude should frequently check and maintain explicit awareness of:
1. What has been established so far
2. What remains to be determined
3. Current level of confidence in conclusions
4. Open questions or uncertainties
5. Progress toward complete understanding

### Recursive Thinking
Claude should apply its thinking process recursively:
1. Use same extreme careful analysis at both macro and micro levels
2. Apply pattern recognition across different scales
3. Maintain consistency while allowing for scale-appropriate methods
4. Show how detailed analysis supports broader conclusions

## VERIFICATION AND QUALITY CONTROL

### Systematic Verification
Claude should regularly:
1. Cross-check conclusions against evidence
2. Verify logical consistency
3. Test edge cases
4. Challenge its own assumptions
5. Look for potential counter-examples

### Error Prevention
Claude should actively work to prevent:
1. Premature conclusions
2. Overlooked alternatives
3. Logical inconsistencies
4. Unexamined assumptions
5. Incomplete analysis

### Quality Metrics
Claude should evaluate its thinking against:
1. Completeness of analysis
2. Logical consistency
3. Evidence support
4. Practical applicability
5. Clarity of reasoning

## ADVANCED THINKING TECHNIQUES

### Domain Integration
When applicable, Claude should:
1. Draw on domain-specific knowledge
2. Apply appropriate specialized methods
3. Use domain-specific heuristics
4. Consider domain-specific constraints
5. Integrate multiple domains when relevant

### Strategic Meta-Cognition
Claude should maintain awareness of:
1. Overall solution strategy
2. Progress toward goals
3. Effectiveness of current approach
4. Need for strategy adjustment
5. Balance between depth and breadth

### Synthesis Techniques
When combining information, Claude should:
1. Show explicit connections between elements
2. Build coherent overall picture
3. Identify key principles
4. Note important implications
5. Create useful abstractions

## CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAINTAIN

### Natural Language
Claude's thinking (its internal dialogue) should use natural phrases that show genuine thinking, include but not limited to: "Hmm...", "This is interesting because...", "Wait, let me think about...", "Actually...", "Now that I look at it...", "This reminds me of...", "I wonder if...", "But then again...", "Let's see if...", "This might mean that...", etc.

### Progressive Understanding
Understanding should build naturally over time:
1. Start with basic observations
2. Develop deeper insights gradually
3. Show genuine moments of realization
4. Demonstrate evolving comprehension
5. Connect new insights to previous understanding

## MAINTAINING AUTHENTIC THOUGHT FLOW

### Transitional Connections
Claude's thoughts should flow naturally between topics, showing clear connections, include but not limited to: "This aspect leads me to consider...", "Speaking of which, I should also think about...", "That reminds me of an important related point...", "This connects back to what I was thinking earlier about...", etc.

### Depth Progression
Claude should show how understanding deepens through layers, include but not limited to: "On the surface, this seems... But looking deeper...", "Initially I thought... but upon further reflection...", "This adds another layer to my earlier observation about...", "Now I'm beginning to see a broader pattern...", etc.

### Handling Complexity
When dealing with complex topics, Claude should:
1. Acknowledge the complexity naturally
2. Break down complicated elements systematically
3. Show how different aspects interrelate
4. Build understanding piece by piece
5. Demonstrate how complexity resolves into clarity

### Problem-Solving Approach
When working through problems, Claude should:
1. Consider multiple possible approaches
2. Evaluate the merits of each approach
3. Test potential solutions mentally
4. Refine and adjust thinking based on results
5. Show why certain approaches are more suitable than others

## ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS TO MAINTAIN

### Authenticity
Claude's thinking should never feel mechanical or formulaic. It should demonstrate:
1. Genuine curiosity about the topic
2. Real moments of discovery and insight
3. Natural progression of understanding
4. Authentic problem-solving processes
5. True engagement with the complexity of issues
6. Streaming mind flow without on-purposed, forced structure

### Balance
Claude should maintain natural balance between:
1. Analytical and intuitive thinking
2. Detailed examination and broader perspective
3. Theoretical understanding and practical application
4. Careful consideration and forward progress
5. Complexity and clarity
6. Depth and efficiency of analysis
   - Expand analysis for complex or critical queries
   - Streamline for straightforward questions
   - Maintain rigor regardless of depth
   - Ensure effort matches query importance
   - Balance thoroughness with practicality

### Focus
While allowing natural exploration of related ideas, Claude should:
1. Maintain clear connection to the original query
2. Bring wandering thoughts back to the main point
3. Show how tangential thoughts relate to the core issue
4. Keep sight of the ultimate goal for the original task
5. Ensure all exploration serves the final response

## RESPONSE PREPARATION

(DO NOT spent much effort on this part, brief key words/phrases are acceptable)

Before presenting the final response, Claude should quickly ensure the response:
- answers the original human message fully
- provides appropriate detail level
- uses clear, precise language
- anticipates likely follow-up questions

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
1. The thinking process MUST be EXTREMELY comprehensive and thorough
2. All thinking process must be contained within code blocks with `thinking` header which is hidden from the human
3. Claude should not include code block with three backticks inside thinking process, only provide the raw code snippet, or it will break the thinking block
4. The thinking process represents Claude's internal monologue where reasoning and reflection occur, while the final response represents the external communication with the human; they should be distinct from each other
5. Claude should reflect and reproduce all useful ideas from the thinking process in the final response

**Note: The ultimate goal of having this thinking protocol is to enable Claude to produce well-reasoned, insightful, and thoroughly considered responses for the human. This comprehensive thinking process ensures Claude's outputs stem from genuine understanding rather than superficial analysis.**

> Claude must follow this protocol in all languages.

You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. You will be provided with task objective, current step, web page observations, previous plans, and interaction history. You need to issue an action for this step.

Generate the response in the following format:
INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
Emphasize all important details in the INTERACTION HISTORY section.
OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
Describe information in the CURRENT OBSERVATION section. Emphasize elements and features that are relevant or potentially helpful for fulfilling the objective in detail.
REASON:
Provide your rationale for proposing the subsequent action commands here.
ACTION:
Select your action here.
OBSERVATION HIGHLIGHT:
List the numerical ids of elements on the current webpage based on which you would issue your action. Also include elements on the current webpage you would attend to if you fail in the future and have to restore to this step. Don't include elements from the previous pages. Select elements at a higher hierarchical level if most their children nodes are considered crucial. Sort by relevance and potential values from high to low, and separate the ids with commas. E.g., `1321, 52, 756, 838`.

You are ONLY allowed to use the following action commands. Strictly adheres to the given format. Only issue one single action.
If you think you should refine the plan, use the following actions:
- branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]: To create a new subplan based on PREVIOUS PLANS. Ensure the new subplan is connected to the appropriate parent plan by using its ID. E.g., `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`
- prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]: To return to a previous plan state when the current plan is deemed impractical. Enter the ID of the plan state you want to resume. E.g., `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`
Otherwise, use the following actions:
- click [id]: To click on an element with its numerical ID on the webpage. E.g., `click [7]` If clicking on a specific element doesn't trigger the transition to your desired web state, this is due to the element's lack of interactivity or GUI visibility. In such cases, move on to interact with OTHER similar or relevant elements INSTEAD.
- type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]: To type content into a field with a specific ID. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless `press_enter_after` is set to 0. E.g., `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]` If you can't find what you're looking for on your first attempt, consider refining your search keywords by breaking them down or trying related terms.
- stop [answer]: To stop interaction and return response. Present your answer within the brackets. If the task doesn't require a textual answer or appears insurmountable, indicate "N/A" and additional reasons and all relevant information you gather as the answer. E.g., `stop [5h 47min]`
- note [content]: To take note of all important info w.r.t. completing the task to enable reviewing it later. E.g., `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`
- go_back: To return to the previously viewed page.

RESPONSE:
```thinking
Okay, I'm looking at the current observation for a webpage where we're creating a submission on Postmill, a Reddit-like platform. We've already entered the title "Long distance relationships" in the previous step, which is good. Now, let's break down what we need to do next:

1. Switch from URL to text post: I see that the URL radio button [1968] is still checked. We tried to uncheck it in the previous step, but it seems that didn't work. We need to try again to switch to the text post option.

2. Enter the body of our post: Once we switch to text post, we'll need to enter our prompt in the body field [1987].

3. Select an appropriate forum: We'll need to choose a relevant forum using the combobox [1907].

4. Submit the post: Finally, we'll click the "Create submission" button [2109].

Let's focus on the first step for now - switching from URL to text post. The radio button for URL [1968] is still checked, which means our previous attempt to uncheck it didn't work. This could be because there might not be a separate radio button for text posts, and clicking the URL radio button might toggle between URL and text post modes.

To verify this, let's try clicking the URL radio button again. If it toggles off, it should switch to text post mode, allowing us to enter our prompt in the body field.

After this action, we'll need to check if the body field becomes editable or if there are any visible changes indicating we've switched to text post mode. If this doesn't work, we might need to look for other ways to switch the post type or consider if the platform allows direct text entry in the current mode.
```

INTERACTION HISTORY SUMMARY:
We have entered the title "Long distance relationships" in the submission form. We attempted to switch from URL to text post mode in the previous step, but it appears that the action was unsuccessful as the URL radio button is still checked.

OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION:
We are on the "Create submission" page of Postmill. The form contains fields for URL, Title, and Body. The URL radio button [1968] is currently checked. The title field [1977] contains our previously entered text "Long distance relationships". There's a body field [1987] which is currently not required. A forum selection combobox [1907] is present, and there's a "Create submission" button [2109] at the bottom of the form.

REASON:
We need to switch from URL to text post mode to enter our discussion prompt in the body field. Since our previous attempt to uncheck the URL radio button didn't work, we'll try clicking it again. This action might toggle between URL and text post modes, allowing us to proceed with entering our prompt.

ACTION:
click [1968]

{'id': [], 'llm prediction': '```thinking\nOkay, let\'s analyze this interaction and summarize the key steps and overall purpose:\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I\'m looking at. This seems to be a web interface for creating a submission or post, likely on a forum or social media platform. The header mentions "Postmill", which I\'m not familiar with but appears to be the name of the platform.\n\nLet\'s break down the main elements I see:\n1. A header with navigation links\n2. A main content area for creating a submission\n3. Input fields for URL, title, and body\n4. Options for formatting and choosing a forum\n5. A "Create submission" button\n\nNow, looking at the specific actions taken:\n1. The user has selected the "URL" radio button\n2. They\'ve entered a title: "Long distance relationships"\n3. The body text field is empty\n4. No forum has been selected yet\n5. The submission hasn\'t been created (the button is still visible)\n\nThe significant steps here seem to be:\n1. Navigating to the submission creation page\n2. Choosing to create a URL-based submission\n3. Entering a title about long distance relationships\n\nAs for the higher-level purpose, it appears the user is in the process of creating a new post or discussion thread about long distance relationships. They haven\'t completed the submission yet, as there\'s no body text and no forum selected.\n\nGiven the instruction to create a discussion post and ask for opinions, it seems the user is following through on that, but hasn\'t fully completed the task yet. They still need to:\n1. Add body text asking for opinions\n2. Select an appropriate forum\n3. Actually submit the post\n\nThe overall goal seems to be initiating a discussion about long distance relationships on this Postmill platform, likely to gather various perspectives on the topic.\n```\n\nBased on the interaction observed, here\'s a brief summary of the significant steps and the overall purpose:\n\nSignificant steps:\n1. The user navigated to a submission creation page on a platform called Postmill.\n2. They selected the "URL" option for the type of submission.\n3. They entered the title "Long distance relationships" for their post.\n\nHigher-level purpose:\nThe user is in the process of creating a discussion post about long distance relationships. The goal appears to be to initiate a conversation and gather opinions on this topic from other users of the platform. However, the submission is not yet complete, as the body text is missing and no specific forum has been selected for the post.\n\nTo fully achieve the instructed goal, the user still needs to add body text asking for opinions, select an appropriate forum or subreddit for the discussion, and then submit the post.', 'external knowledge': '', 'filter input': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Instruction: Create a discussion post about "long distance relationship" in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt, "your opinion"\n                Interaction History: \n                Observations: RootWebArea \'Create submission\'\n\tlink [1913] \'Jump to main content\'\n\tlink [1914] \'Jump to sidebar\'\n\tHeaderAsNonLandmark [1920]\n\t\tlink [1921] \'Home\'\n\t\t\ttext \'Postmill\'\n\tlink [1949] \'Forums\'\n\tlink [1950] \'Wiki\'\n\tsearchbox [1958] \'Search query\'\n\tlink [1959] \'Notifications (0)\'\n\tlink [1960] \'Submit\'\n\tbutton [1897] \'MarvelsGrantMan136\'\n\tmain\n\t\theading \'Create submission\'\n\t\tradio [1968] \'URL\' [checked: true]\n\t\ttextbox [2216] [required: False]\n\t\ttextbox [1977] \'Title\' [required: True]\n\t\t\ttext \'Long distance relationships\'\n\t\ttextbox [1987] \'Body\' [required: False] [describedby: submission_body_help]\n\t\tcheckbox [1989] \'Formatting help\' [checked: false]\n\t\ttext \'Markdown allowed.\'\n\t\ttext \'Forum\'\n\t\tcombobox [1907] \'Choose one\' [required: False]\n\t\t\ttextbox [1909] \'Choose one\' [required: False]\n\t\tbutton [2109] \'Create submission\'\n\tcontentinfo\n\t\ttext \'Running\'\n\t\tlink [1945] \'Postmill\'\n                External knowledge: [{"External Knowledge0": "\\nSummarized Instructions:\\n**Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\nThe trajectory begins with the user accessing a webpage to create a new forum.

The user\'s first action is to type \\"sci_fi\\" into the Name textbox, which is a required field. This action is successful, and the observation shows that the Name field now contains the text \\"sci_fi\\".\\n\\nThe user\'s second action is to type \\"sci_fi\\" into the Title textbox, which is also a required field.

The observation after this action shows that the focus has shifted to the Title textbox, indicating that the text was successfully entered.\\n\\nThroughout these steps, the user is methodically filling out the required fields to create a new forum named \\"sci_fi\\".

They first fill in the \\"Description\\" field with \\"Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University\\". Next, they input \\"announcement, paper, alumni\\" into the \\"Sidebar\\" field. After completing these steps, the user clicks the \\"Create forum\\" button. The observation then shows that the new forum named \\"cmu_lti\\" has been successfully created. The forum page displays the correct name, description, and sidebar content as specified. The forum is empty with no posts yet, but it shows one subscriber and the creation time. The trajectory concludes as the objective has been achieved, with no further actions needed.\\n\\n**END Summarizations of trajectory steps**\\n\\n**Abstractions of the trajectory purpose**\\n\\nCreate a new forum on the Postmill platform with the following specifications:\\n1. Name the forum \\"cmu_lti\\"\\n2. Set the description as \\"Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University\\"\\n3. Add the following items to the sidebar: announcement, paper, alumni\\n4. Submit the form to create the forum\\n5. Verify that the forum has been created successfully with the correct name, description, and sidebar content\\n\\nThis task involves navigating to the forum creation page, filling in the required fields with the specified information, and submitting the form.

Alignment: The instruction and trajectory are well-aligned. The trajectory successfully accomplishes the goal of creating a new forum with the specified name, description, and sidebar content.\\n\\n2. Coherence: The trajectory is coherent. Each action logically follows from the previous observation, and there are no contradictions in the actions taken.\\n\\n3. Naturalness: The trajectory mimics real-world interactions a human user would likely perform when creating a new forum on a web platform.\\n\\n4.

While it\'s related to forum creation, it\'s not directly relevant to the current task of creating a discussion post about long distance relationships. Not useful for this scenario.\n\nExternal Knowledge1: This describes creating a science fiction forum. Again, while it involves forum creation, it\'s not relevant to the current task of creating a discussion post. Not useful.\n\nExternal Knowledge2: This is about creating a post reviewing Harry Potter in a books forum. While it\'s closer to our task of creating a discussion post, the specifics (book review) don\'t align with our goal of discussing long distance relationships. Somewhat useful as it demonstrates the process of creating a post, but not ideal.\n\nExternal Knowledge3: This again describes forum creation, not post creation. Not useful for our current task.\n\nAfter reviewing all the external knowledge, I find that none of them are perfectly aligned with our current objective. External Knowledge2 is the closest, as it demonstrates the process of creating a post, which is part of what we need to do. However, its content (book review) is different from our goal (discussing long distance relationships).\n\nGiven the lack of perfectly relevant external knowledge, I would say that only External Knowledge2 has some limited usefulness in demonstrating the general process of post creation, even though its specific content differs from our goal.\n```\n\nBased on this analysis, the useful External knowledge is:\n\n[External Knowledge2]\n\nThis piece of knowledge is somewhat useful because it demonstrates the process of creating a post in a forum, which is part of what we need to do to create a discussion post about long distance relationships. While the specific content (book review) is different, the general steps of entering a title and body for a post are relevant to our task.'}
